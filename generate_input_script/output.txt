14PREFACE
TO
THE
FIRST
EDITION
On
June
26
2000
the
sciences
of
biology
and
medicine
changed
forever
Prime
Minister
of
the
United
Kingdom
Tony
Blair
and
President
of
the
United
States
Bill
Clinton
held
a
joint
press
conference
linked
via
satellite
to
announce
the
completion
of
the
draft
of
the
Human
Genome
The
New
York
Times
ran
a
banner
headline
Genetic
Code
of
Human
Life
is
Cracked
by
Scientists
The
sequence
of
3
billion
bases
was
the
culmination
of
over
a
decade
of
work
during
which
the
goal
was
always
clearly
in
sight
and
the
only
questions
were
how
fast
the
technology
could
progress
and
how
generously
the
funding
would
flow
The
Table
shows
some
of
the
landmarks
along
the
way
Next
to
the
politicians
stood
the
scientists
John
Sulston
Director
of
the
Wellcome
Trust
Sanger
Institute
in
the
UK
had
been
a
key
player
since
the
beginning
of
highthroughput
sequencing
methods
He
had
grown
with
the
project
from
the
earliest
one
man
and
a
dog
stages
to
the
current
international
consortium
In
the
US
appearing
with
President
Clinton
were
Francis
Collins
director
of
the
US
National
Human
Genome
Research
Institute
representing
the
US
publiclyfunded
efforts
and
J
Craig
Venter
President
and
Chief
Scientific
Officer
of
Celera
Genomics
Corporation
representing
the
commercial
sector
It
is
difficult
to
introduce
these
two
without
thinking
In
this
corner
and
in
this
corner
Although
never
actually
coming
to
blows
there
was
certainly
intense
competition
in
the
later
stages
a
race
The
race
was
more
than
an
effort
to
finish
first
and
receive
scientific
credit
for
priority
Indeed
it
was
a
race
after
which
the
contestants
would
be
tested
not
for
whether
they
had
taken
drugs
but
whether
they
and
others
could
discover
them
Clinical
applications
were
a
prime
motive
for
support
of
the
Human
Genome
Project
Once
the
courts
had
held
that
gene
sequences
were
patentablewith
enormous
potential
payoffs
for
drugs
based
on
themthe
commercial
sector
rushed
to
submit
patents
on
sets
of
sequences
that
they
determined
and
the
academic
groups
rushed
to
place
each
bit
of
sequence
that
they
determined
into
the
public
domain
to
prevent
Celeraor
anyone
elsefrom
applying
for
patents
The
academic
groups
lined
up
against
Celera
were
a
collaborating
group
of
laboratories
primarily
but
not
exclusively
in
the
UK
and
USA
These
included
the
Wellcome

Sanger
Institute
in
England
Washington

St

Missouri
the
Whitehead

Genome
Institute
at
Lawrence
Livermore
National
Laboratory
in
Livermore
California
and
the
RIKEN
Genomic
Sciences
Center
now
in
Yokahama
Japan
Both
sides
could
dip
into
deep
pockets
Celera
had
its
original
venture
capitalists
its
current
parent
company
PE
Corporation
and
after
going
public
anyone
who
cared
to
take
a

The
Wellcome

Institute
was
supported

the

The

The

Announcement
of
completion
of
human
genome
sequence
The
human
genome
is
only
one
of
the
many
complete
genome
sequences
known
Taken
together
genome
sequences
from
organisms
distributed
widely
among
the
branches
of
the
tree
of
life
give
us
a
sense
only
hinted
at
before
of
the
very
great
unity
in
detail
of
all
life
on
Earth
They
have
changed
our
perceptions
much
as
the
first
pictures
of
the
Earth
from
space
engendered
a
unified
view
of
our
planet
The
sequencing
of
the
human
genome
sequence
ranks
with
the
Manhattan
project
that
produced
atomic
weapons
during
the
Second
World
War
and
the
space
program
that
sent
people
to
the
Moon
as
one
of
the
great
bursts
of
technological
achievement
of
the
last
century
These
projects
share
a
grounding
in
fundamental
science
and
largescale
and
expensive
engineering
development
and
support
For
biology
neither
the
attitudes
nor
the
budgets
will
ever
be
the
same
Soon
a
one
man
and
a
dog
project
will
refer
only
to
an
afternoons
undergraduate
practical
experiment
in
sequencing
and
comparison
of
two
mammalian
genomes
The
human
genome
is
fundamentally
about
information
and
computers
were
essential
both
for
the
determination
of
the
sequence
and
for
the
applications
to
biology
and
medicine
that
are
already
flowing
from
it
Computing
contributed
not
only
the
raw
capacity
for
processing
and
storage
of
data
but
also
the
mathematicallysophisticated
methods
required
to
achieve
the
results
The
marriage
of
biology
and
computer
science
has
created
a
new
field
called
bioinformatics
Today
bioinformatics
is
an
applied
science
We
use
computer
programs
to
make
inferences
from
16the
data
archives
of
modern
molecular
biology
to
make
connections
among
them
and
to
derive
useful
and
interesting
predictions
This
book
is
aimed
at
students
and
practising
scientists
who
need
to
know
how
to
access
the
data
archives
of
genomes
and
proteins
the
tools
that
have
been
developed
to
work
with
these
archives
and
the
kinds
of
questions
that
these
data
and
tools
can
answer
In
fact
there
are
a
lot
of
sources
of
this
information
Sites
treating
topics
in
bioinformatics
are
sprawled
out
all
over
the
Web
The
challenge
is
to
select
an
essential
core
of
this
material
and
to
describe
it
clearly
and
coherently
at
an
introductory
level
It
is
assumed
that
the
reader
already
has
some
knowledge
of
modern
molecular
biology
and
some
facility
at
using
a
computer
The
purpose
of
this
book
is
to
build
on
and
develop
this
background
It
is
suitable
as
a
textbook
for
advanced
undergraduates
or
beginning
postgraduate
students
Many
workedout
examples
are
integrated
into
the
text
and
references
to
useful

opportunities
to

Three
types
of
problems
appear
at
the
ends
of
chapters
Exercises
are
short
and
straightforward
applications
of
material
in
the
text
Problems
also
require
no
information
not
contained

but
require
lengthier
answers
or
in
some
cases
calculations
The
third
category
Weblems
require
access
to
the
Worldwide
Web
Weblems
are
designed
to
give
readers
practice
with
the
tools
required
for
further
study
and
research
in
the
field
What
has
made
it
possible
to
try
to
write
such
a
book
now
is
the
extent
to
which
the
Worldwide
Web
has
made
easily
accessible
both
the
archives
themselves
and
the
programs
that
deal
with
them
In
the
past
it
was
necessary
to
install
programs
and
data
on
ones
own
system
and
run
calculations
locally
Of
course
this
meant
that
everything
was
dependent
on
the
facilities
available
Now
it
is
possible
to
channel
all
the
work
through
an
interface
to
the
Web
The
web
site
linked
with
this
book
will
ease
the
transition
To
ensure
that
readers
will
be
able
freely
to
pursue
discussions
in
the
book
onto
the
Web
descriptions
of
and
references
to
commercial
software
have
been
avoided
although
many
commercial
packages
are
of
very
high
quality
A
serious
problem
with
the
web
is
its
volatility
Sites
come
and
go
leaving
trails
of
dead
links
in
their
wake
There
are
so
many
sites
that
it
is
necessary
to
try
to
find
a
few
gateways
that
are
stable
not
only
continuing
to
exist
but
also
kept
uptodate
in
both
their
contents
and
links
I
have
suggested
some
such
sites
but
many
others
are
just
as
good
The
problem
is
not
to
create
a
long
list
of
useful
sitesthis
has
been
done
many
times
and
is
relatively
easybut
to
create
a
short
onethis
is
much
harder
Some
computing
is
introduced
in
this
book
based
on
the
widely
available
language
PERL
Examples
of
simple
PERL
programs
appear
in
the
context
of
biological
problems
Many
simple
PERL
tasks
are
assigned
as
exercises
or
problems
at
the
ends
of
the
chapters
Where
might
the
reader
turn
next
This
book
is
designed
as
a
companion
volumein
current
parlance
a
prequelto

and
that
title
is
of
course
recommended
Other
books
on
sequence
analysis
range
from
those
oriented
towards
biology
to
others
in
the
field
of
computer
science
The
goal
is
that
each
reader
will
come
to
recognize
his
or
her
own
interests
and
be
equipped
to
follow
them
up
17PREFACE
TO
THE
SECOND
EDITION
Bioinformatics
has
grown
since
the
first
edition
of
this
book
appeared
The
most
striking
change
has
been
a
refocus
on
integration
that
is
of
trying
to
see
life
processes
as
unified
systems
As
I
wrote
at
the
end
of
Introduction
to
Protein
Science
Architecture
Function
and
Genomics
During
the
last
century
molecular
biologists
have
been
taking
living
things
apart
Our
task
now
is
to
understand
how
to
put
them
back
together
We
have
had
large
amounts
of
data
Now
we
are
trying
to
see
how
they
interrelate
At
the
heart
of
life
processes
are
complicated
patterns
of
interaction
among
the
components
in
space
and
in
time
To
understand
these
patterns
the
field
has
moved
towards
combining
information
into
networks
and
trying
to
understand
their
structures
and
dynamics
Supporting
this
venture
are
the
growing
streams
of
data
The
human
genome
available
in
draft
form
when
the
first
edition
appeared
is
now
complete
It
is
joined
by
the
complete
genomes
of
18
archaea
155
bacteria
over
30
eukarya
and
many
other
organelle
and
viral
sequences
These
genomes
illuminate
each
other
One
story
that
they
tell
is
about
unsuspected
underlying
unities
of
all
living
things
despite
the
obvious
and
profound
differences
in
morphology
and
lifestyle
Genomic
sequences
are
supplemented
by
other
data
streams
notably
the
proteome
Knowing
patterns
of
gene
expression
and
networks
of
regulatory
interactions
shows
how
cells
and
organisms
implement
the
information
in
the
DNA
The
potential
for
the
life
of
an
organism
is
contained
in
its
genome
but
it
would
be
impossible
to
deduce
a
biography
from
it
Genomes
are
not
formulas
or
scripts
It
is
in
the
proteins
and
their
interactions
with
themselves
and
with
DNA
that
we
must
seek
the
set
of
activities
contingent
on
and
responsive
to
the
environment
Proteomics
is
giving
us
the
information
we
need
to
see
how
the
system
works
Research
and
applications
require
that
the
data
be
available
in
useful
form
It
is
not
enough
to
make
the
data
public
The
information
must
be
subjected
to
quality
control
annotation
and
a
logical
structure
must
be
imposed
on
it
to
make
information
retrieval
possible
For
this
we
are
indebted
to
the
institutions
that
archive
curate
organize
and
distribute
the
data
A
recent
trend
has
seen
mergers
of
these
groups
into
collaborative
projects
spanning
the
continents
In
accord
with
the
need
to
integrate
the
study
of
different
types
of
data
we
are
moving
in
the
direction
of
a
single
biological
data
repository
Individual
scientists
will
be
able
to
define
virtual
databanks
tailoring
access
to
the
information
to
suit
particular
needs
and
interests
A
gratifying
consequence
of
academic
bioinformatics
is
its
contributions
to
applications
in
medicine
agriculture
and
technology
A
better
understanding
of
life
processes
empowers
us
to
deal
with
them
when
they
go
wrong
18PREFACE
TO
THE
THIRD
EDITION
Major
changes
in
molecular
biology
since
the
second
edition
most
prominently
involve
the
great
growth
in
new
complete
genome
sequences
that
have
become
available
These
are
results
of
enhancements
in
methods
of
sequence
determination
The
extension
to
metagenomicsthe
survey
of
distributions
of
sequences
in
a
region
of
the
earth
or
oceanis
new
Major
changes
in
information
distribution
involve
the
accelerating
transition
from
paper
to
electronic
libraries
A
new
chapter
treating
this
subject
appears
in
this
edition
The
implications
for
scientific
research
are
only
a
part
of
the
great
social
revolution
that
has
flowed
from
the
development
of
the
Web
comparable
to
if
not
exceeding
the
one
impelled
by
the
printing
press
500
years
ago
There
are
many
different
possible
points
of
view
from
which
to
present
molecular
biology
Bioinformatics
is
one
of
them
I
have
also
written
about
genomics
and
about
proteins
in
companion
volumes
also
published
by
Oxford
University
Press
Introduction
to
Protein
Science
Architecture
Function
and
Genomics
and
Introduction
to
Genomics
As
a
result
this
book
is
focussed
more
tightly
on
the
applied
science
of
bioinformatics
Readers
are
urged
to
put
the
books
together
for
a
more
rounded
appreciation
of
the
pageant
and
mechanisms
of
life
19PREFACE
TO
THE
FOURTH
EDITION
The
natural
habitat
of
bioinformatics
is
the
web
Previous
versions
of
this
book
recognized
this
to
some
extent
with
an
Online
Resource
Centre
supplementing
the
text
With
this
edition
the
online
material
assumes
a
full
partnership
To
learn
bioinformatics
means
to
understand
basic
concepts
and
principles
and
to
develop
a
set
of
skills
The
paper
text
contains
an
exposition
of
the
concepts
and
principles
the
Online
Resource
Centre
is
the
equivalent
of
a
laboratory
or
practical
component
of
the
course
An
icon
in
the
text
indicates
the
appearance
in
the
Online
Resource
Centre
of
material
related
to
current
discussion
The
data
of
bioinformatics
are
accessible
on
the
web
Programs
to
analyse
them
are
available
on
the
web
Indeed
many
authors
of
programs
provide
web
servers
for
remote
access
to
the
calculations
Links
from
databases
to
servers
streamline
the
passage
from
data
retrieval
to
data
analysis
Such
facilities
supersede
the
old
procedure
of
download
the
data
onto
your
computer
install
the
program
on
your
computer
and
run
it
locally
All
research
in
contemporary
molecular
biology
depends
on
data
and
programs
to
retrieve
and
analyse
them
There
is
consensus
that
all
biomedical
scientists
must
achieve
a
minimum
of
programming
skills
but
there
is
vigorous
debate
over
what
this
minimum
level
should
be
The
point
of
view
expressed
in
this
book
is
that
molecular
biologists
based
primarily
in
a
wet
lab
must
dip
no
more
than
their
toes
into
the
stream
those
based
primarily
at
a
computer
must
wade
in
up
to
their
waist
perhaps
but
only
those
specializing
in
computer
science
and
software
development
must
undergo
total
immersion
Indeed
one
of
the
arguments
for
the
suggestion
that
sophisticated
programming
skills
are
not
generally
required
is
the
great
panoply
of
freely
available
programs
written
by
acknowledged
professionals
What
is
essential
is
developing
skill
in
using
these
programs
and
in
intelligent
interpretion
of
the
results
that
they
produce
This
is
the
goal
of
the
problems
and
projects
in
the
Online
Resource
Centre
Many
of
them
are
weblems
based
on
data
and
facilities
on
the
web
Some
are
programming
exercises
based
on
the
PERL
language
PERL
is
a
relatively
simple
but
extremely
effective
programming
language
It
is
one
of
the
languages
popular
in
the
bioinformatics
community
Similar
languages
include
PYTHON
and
RUBY
each
of
these
has
its
adherents
For
PERL
and
for
the
other
languages
an
extensive
repertoire
of
utilizable
program
components
is
available
both
general
see
eg
T
Christiansen
and
N
Torkington
Perl
Cookbook
2nd
edn
OReilly
Media
Sebastopol
CA
2003
and
specialized
wwwbioperlorg
Some
of
the
PERL
exercises
in
the
Online
Resource
Centre
involve
modifying
programs
Such
challenges
can
be
more
focused
than
writing
programs
from
scratch
Some
of
the
exercises
problems
and
weblems
although
not
requiring
any
programming
can
be
solved
more
easily
by
writing
short
PERL
programs
Readers
are
encouraged
to
try
this
approach
whenever
appropriate
In
addition
to
PERL
the
minimal
computing
skills
essential
for
a
biomedical
scientist
would
include
facility
with
using
social
media
for
communication
it
is
assumed
that
readers
are
familiar
with
Facebook
and
YouTube
but
there
are
others
that
are
in
use
for
communication
among
scientists
and
the
ability
to
create
a
website
Studying
from
this
book
and
the
Online
Resource
20Centre
affords
an
opportunity
to
practise
these
skills
You
might
for
instance
turn
in
the
answers
to
homework
assignments
by
gathering
them
into
a
web
page
Questions
about
statements
that
you
and
the
other
students
found
unclear
in
your
instructors
lecturesor
conceivably
even
in
this
book
could
be
shared
and
discussed
in
a
blog
Indeed
there
is
now
a
trend
to
integrating
websites
and
social
media
However
there
are
security
issues
Your
instructor
might
be
unhappy
if
everyone
copied
the
answers
to
the
exercises
from
the
first
student
to
post
them
A
class
taught
from
this
book
would
afford
a
fine
opportunity
to
explore
the
possibilities
and
challenges
21PLAN
OF
THE
BOOK
Chapter
1
sets
the
stage
and
introduces
all
of
the
major
players
DNA
and
protein
sequences
and
structures
genomes
and
proteomes
databases
and
information
retrieval
the
worldwide
web
computer
programming
Before
developing
individual
topics
in
detail
it
is
important
to
see
the
framework
of
their
interactions
Chapter
2
presents
the
nature
of
individual
genomes
including
the
human
genome
and
the
relationships
among
them
from
the
biological
point
of
view
Chapter
3
describes
the
current
state
of
the
scientific
literature
as
it
makes
the
transition
from
paper
to
electronic
form
This
transition
has
many
consequences
both
intellectual
and
practical
It
has
had
profound
effects
on
research
in
bioinformatics
Chapter
4
imparts
basic
skills
in
using
the
web
in
bioinformatics
It
describes
archival
databanks
and
leads
the
reader
through
sample
sessions
involving
information
retrieval
from
some
of
the
major
archival
databases
in
molecular
biology
Chapter
5
treats
the
analysis
of
relationships
among
sequences
alignments
and
phylogenetic
trees
These
methods
underlie
some
of
the
major
computational
challenges
of
bioinformatics
detecting
distant
relatives
understanding
relationships
among
genomes
of
different
organisms
and
tracing
the
course
of
evolution
at
the
species
and
molecular
levels
Chapter
6
moves
into
three
dimensions
treating
protein
structure
and
folding
Sequence
and
structure
must
be
seen
as
full
partners
with
bioinformatics
developing
methods
for
moving
back
and
forth
between
them
as
fluently
as
possible
Understanding
protein
structures
in
detail
is
essential
for
determining
their
mechanisms
of
action
and
for
clinical
and
pharmacological
applications
Chapter
7
introduces
systems
biology
The
key
idea
of
systems
biology
is
integration
how
do
all
the
pieces
fit
together
How
do
they
interact
How
do
the
individual
molecules
and
processes
together
create
a
whole
that
so
far
transcends
the
pieces
in
selfsufficiency
Chapter
8
describes
metabolic
pathways
The
activities
of
individual
enzymes
are
the
subject
matter
of
classical
biochemistry
Understanding
their
controls
has
been
a
goal
of
molecular
biology
revealing
a
variety
of
mechanisms
at
the
levels
of
transcription
translation
post
translational
modifications
and
the
interaction
of
inhibitors
and
allosteric
effectors
with
enzymes
themselves
The
integration
of
these
controls
is
a
development
of
systems
biology
as
a
continuation
of
Chapter
7
Chapter
9
deals
with
gene
expression
another
development
of
systems
biology
Gene
expression
is
of
course
a
component
of
metabolism
but
gene
expression
exerts
comprehensive
control
over
cell
structure
and
function
Gene
expression
is
involved
in
responses
to
stimuli
and
changes
in
the
cells
environment
and
governs
short
and
longterm
developmental
processes

LEARNING
GOALS
To
gain
an
overview
of
the
subject
the
topics
the
questions
the
point
of
view
and
examples
of
specific
problems
and
how
to
solve
them
Many
of
the
topics
introduced
in
this
chapter
are
developed
elsewhere
in
the
book
To
review
and
assemble
the
general
principles
of
molecular
biology
necessary
for
dealing
with
data
on
sequences
structures
interactions
metabolism
and
regulation
To
appreciate
the
very
high
capacity
of
the
data
streams
that
are
producing
data
for
molecular
biology
notably
but
not
limited
to

The
challenge
of
giving
a
manageable
form
to
these
data
is
the
province
of
bioinformatics
To
understand
the
essential
characteristics
of
a
database
its
coverage
its
organization
and
the
access
routes
to
retrieve
the
information
it
contains
To

the
importance
of
quality
control
and
annotation
in
data
curation
To
understand
the
role
of
computer
hardware
and
software
in
the
infrastructure
of
bioinformatics
To
evaluate
your
own
talents
skills
and
interest
and
to
decide
to
what
extent
you
want
to
create
programs
and
the
extent
to
which
you
want
no
more
than
to
develop

in
their

To
know
the
basic
principles
of
protein
structure
and
the
extent
to
which

can
be
predicted
from

To
be
familiar
with
the
type
of
questions
that
the
fields
of
transcriptomics
and
proteomics
address
and
the
methods
used
to
collect
and
analyse
the
data
required
to
answer
them
To
appreciate
the
clinical
implications
of
discoveries
in
molecular

and
the
role
of
bioinformatics
in
forging
links
between
laboratory

To
distinguish
between
static

instance
the

such
as

and
to
recognize
that
underlying
the
dynamic

are
extensive
and
complex

mechanisms
Biology
has
traditionally
been
an
observational
rather
than
a
deductive
science
Although
recent
developments
have
not
altered
this
basic
orientation
the
nature
of
the
data
has
changed
radically
It
is
arguable
that
until
recently
most
biological
observations
were
fundamentally
anecdotal
although
admittedly
with
varying
degrees
of
precision
some
of
which
were
very
high
indeed
However
in
the
most
recent
generation
the
data
have
become
not
only
much
more
quantitative
and
precise
in
the
case
of
nucleotide
and
amino
acid
sequences
they
have
become
discrete
It
is
possible
to
determine
the
genome
sequence
of
an
individual
organism
or
clone
not
only
completely
but
in
principle
exactly
Experimental
error
can
never
be
avoided
entirely
but
the
quality
of
modern
genomic
sequencing
methods
is
extremely
high
Not
that
this
has
converted
biology
into
a
deductive
science
Life
does
obey
principles
of
physics
and
chemistry
but
for
now
life
is
too
complex
and
too
dependent
on
historical
contingency
for
us
to
deduce
its
detailed
properties
from
basic
principles
A
second
obvious
property
of
the
data
of
bioinformatics
is
their
very
very
large

The

of

have
encouraged

to
aim

has
been
an

throughout

Now
as

faces
many
extremely
serious

Not

has
bioinformatics
developed
powerful

but
its

are
becoming
more
deeply
integrated
into
the
biomedical
enterprise
Major

typically
have
as

From

life
on
Earth
is
a
complex
selfperpetuating

system
distributed
in

time
It
is
of
the
greatest
significance
that
it

or

Each
species
within
an
ecosystem
is
composed
of
organisms
carrying
out
individual

not
independent
activities
Organisms
are
composed
of

Every
cell
is
an
intimate
local
ecosystem
not
isolated
from
its
environment
but
interacting
with
it
in
specific
and
controlled
ways
Eukaryotic
cells
contain
a
complex
internal

of
their

And
finally
we
come
down

Life
is
extended
not
only
in
space
but
in
time
We
see
today
a
snapshot
of
one
stage
in
the
history
of
life
that
extends
back
in
time
for
at
least
35
billion
1
years
The
theory
of
natural
selection
has
been
extremely
successful
in
rationalizing
the
process
of
lifes
development
However
historical
accident
plays
too
dominant
a
role
in
determining
the
course
of
events
to
allow
much
detailed
prediction
DNA
from
extinct
organisms
affords
only
limited
access
to
the
historical
record
at
the
molecular
level
Instead
we
must
try
to
read
the
past
in
contemporary

US
Supreme

Justice
Felix
Frankfurter
once
wrote
that
the
American
constitution

To
what
extent
do
the
contents
of
our
genomes
determine
who
we
are
Each
reader
of
this
book
is
an
individual
with
physical
biochemical
and
psychological
characteristics
Do
not
be
surprised
if
these
distinctions
become
more
and
more
tenuous
during
your
lifetime
Each
of
you
has
a
general
form
and
metabolism
that
is
common
to
all
humans
and
at
the
molecular
level
much
in
common
with
other
species
as
well
But
there
is
considerable
variation
within
our
species
to
give
you
individual
appearance
and
character
You
are
in
a
state
of
health
somewhere
along
the
spectrum
between
robust
good
health
and
morbid
disease
You
are
currently
in
some
psychological
state
and
in
some
mood
reflecting
your
personality
and
current
activities
Your
genotype
is
your
DNA
sequence
both
nuclear
and
mitochondrial
For
plants
include
also
the
sequence
of
the
chloroplast
DNA
The
genotype
is
inherited
from
your
parents
Your
phenotype
is
the
collection
of
your
observable
traits
other
than
your
genotype
These
include
macroscopic
properties
such
as
height
weight
and
eye
and
hair
colour
and
microscopic
ones
such
as
whether
you
suffer
from
sicklecell
anaemia
and
your
major

complex
MHC
locus
haplotype
Your
life
history
includes
the
integrated
total
of
your
experiences
and
the
physical
and
psychological
environment
within
which
you
developed
Your
nutritional
history
has
influenced
your
physical
development
For
many
a
nurturing
environment
and
educational
opportunities
have
influenced
your
psychological
development
What
is
perhaps
less
obvious
than
most
aspects
of
your
life
history
is
the
growing
recognition
of
the
importance
of
your
in
utero
environment
in
determining
your
development
curve
and
even
your
adult
characteristics
At
the
interface
between
the
genome
and
life
experience
are
epigenetic
factors
It
is
largely
true
that
all
cells
of
your
body
except
sperm
or
egg
cells
erythrocytes
and
cells
of
the
immune
system
have
virtually
the
same
DNA
sequence
Yet
your
tissues
are
differentiated
with
different
sets
of
genes
expressed
or
silenced
in
liver
brain
etc
Some
of
these
regulatory
signals
survive
cell
division
When
a
liver
cell
divides
it
divides
into
two
liver
cells
Your
parents
own
life
28histories
might
have
altered
the
epigenetic
patterns
in
their
cells
and
the
fertilized
egg
from
which
you
were
subsequently
formed
contained
some
of
these
predifferentiation
signals
Via
epigenetics
inheritance
of
acquired
characteristics
has
reentered
respectable
mainstream
biology
The
relative
importance
of
these
factors
in
determining
your
phenotype
varies
from
trait
to
trait
Some
are
determined
exclusively
by
your
alleles
for
single
specific
genes
Others
depend
on
complex
interactions
between
your
genes
and
your
life
history
and
epigenetic
signals
from
your
parents
Evolution
is
the
change
over
time
in
the
world
of
living
things
The
processes
of
evolution
change
distributions
of
genotypes
and
phenotypes
in
successive
generations
The
genotype
is
an
organisms
genetic
information
the
sequence
of
its
genome
All
other
observable
features
of
an
organismmacroscopic
and
biochemicalcomprise
its
phenotype
The
genotype
is
inherited
from
a
parent
or
parents
subject
to
modification
by
mutation
or
by
lateral
transfer
of
genetic
material
The
phenotype
depends
on
the
genotype
including
epigenetic
signals
which
control
the
development
of
the
organism
under
the
influence
of
its
environment
The
asymmetry
between
genotype
and
phenotype
is
the
engine
of
evolution
Changes
in
genotypes
are
inheritable
Effects
on
the
phenotype
of
the
environment
or
lifestyle
for
instance
better
nutrition
leading
to
larger
body
size
or
debilitating
effects
of
disease
or
injury
are
not
directly
inheritable
During
the
development
of
any
organism
genotype
constrains
phenotype
Phenotype
does
not
influence
genotype
Many
genotypes
can
create
the
same
phenotype
For
example
many
mutations
in
genes
coding
for
proteins
leave
amino
acid
sequences
unchanged
or
make
modifications
with
no
apparent
effect
on
function
alleles
are
different
forms
sequences
of
the
same
gene
Any
organism
that
contains
two
copies
of
a
gene
at
equivalent
positions
in
the
genome
can
have
at
that
site
two
copies
of
the
same
allele
homozygosity
or
two
different
alleles
heterozygosity
In
mammals
20
of
loci
are
heterozygous
Homozygotes
and
heterozygotes
have
different
genotypes
but
if
a
single
gene
has
exclusive
control
over
a
trait
and
one
allele
is
dominant
homozygotes
and
heterozygotes
may
have
the
same
phenotype
At
what
levels
does
evolution
operate
Most
life
consists
of
discrete
organisms
A
population
is
a
group
of
similar
organisms
that
interact
Populations
of
sexually
reproducing
organisms
interbreed
individuals
in
all
populations
compete
for
resources
The
processes
of
evolution
alter
the
composition
and
distribution
of
the
gene
pools
and
phenotypes
in
populations
It
is
arguable
that
the
population
is
the
true
unit
of
evolutionary
activity
There
is
nothing
like
a
deme
What
is
the
mechanism
of
evolution
Within
a
population
individuals
with
a
variety
of
genotypes
arise
displaying
a
corresponding
variety
of
phenotypes
Although
selection
has
no
direct
leverage
on
genotype
individuals
with
different
phenotypes
show
differential
success
at
reproduction
As
a
result
the
new
generation
may
have
an
altered
distribution
of
genotypes
and
phenotypes
Natural
selectionenhanced
reproduction
by
fitter
individualsis
the
most
important
mechanism
of
evolution
Another
mechanism
of
evolution
is
genetic
drift
the
random
change
in
allelic
frequencies
which
is
not
in
response
to
selection
Genetic
drift
is
especially
important
in
small
isolated
29populations
Mechanisms
that
produce
genetic
variety
create
the
potential
for
evolution
mutations
such
as
point
substitutions
insertions
and
deletions
and
transpositions
Rates
of
generation
of
point
mutations
are
estimated
to
be
about
10
12
10
10
per
base
pair
per
generation
this
is
not
the
same
as
the
rate
of
allelic
replacement
in
a
population
mutations
only
propose
candidates
for
evolutionary
change
recombination
can
bring
different
loci
together
or
split
them
apart
Recombination
within
a
gene
can
create
a
new
allele
whereas
recombination
outside
of
genes
can
affect
the
relationship
between
genes
and
regulatory
elements
gene
duplication
followed
by
divergence
gene
loss
either
by
deletion
or
by
mutations
that
destroy
expression
or
function
gene
flow
from
mixing
of
populations
or
gene
transfer
between
species
Evolution
can
increase
or
decrease
the
variety
in
gene
pools
If
a
novel
mutation
confers
selective
advantage
only
in
the
homozygous
state
the
gene
may
spread
throughout
a
population
Adoption
of
the
allele
by
all
members
of
a
population
can
decrease
the
variety
in
the
gene
pool
If
a
gene
arises
that
confers
selective
advantage
in
the
heterozygous
state
only
the
gene
pool
may
move
towards
greater
variety
Some
mutations
create
recessive
alleles
that
are
deleterious
only
in
the
homozygous
state
These
are
harder
to
remove
from
a
population
especially
if
heterozygotes
have
some
compensating
advantage
An
example
is
the
gene
for
sicklecell
anaemia
which
confers
on
heterozygotes
an
enhanced
resistance
to
malaria
Microevolution
refers
to
relatively
small
changes
in
a
few
genes
leading
in
most
cases
to
relatively
small
changes
in
phenotypes
Microevolution
affects
the
individuals
within
a
population
Modern
techniques
allow
us
to
follow
microevolution
at
the
molecular
level
through
measurements
of
genome
sequences
and
patterns
of
RNA
transcription
and
protein
expression
Macroevolution
refers
to
largerscale
changes
in
populations
as
a
whole
including
formation
of
new
species
The
fossil
record
provides
a
partial
history
of
macroevolution
revealing
phylogenetic
relationships
using
geological
methods
to
date
events
Comparative
anatomy
and
physiology
and
embryology
provide
additional
clues
Observations
of
micro

macroevolution

Genome
sequences

in

of

The
fossil
record
permits
dating
of
past
events
that
have
had
consequences
on
the

scale
which

to

is
to

the
function
of

Almost
500
scientists
in
32
research
groups
formed
the
consortium
that
tackled
the
problem
The
current
effort
is
the
result
of
a
scaling
up
from
a
pilot
project
started
in
2007
which
focused
on
a
selected

about
30
Mb
of
the
human

deemed
likely
to
be
of

The

that

that

When
the
human
genome
was
first
sequenced
it
appeared
that
there
were
only
about
23
000
proteincoding
genes
accounting
for
about
15
of
the
genome
The
number
of
genes
was
smaller
than
expected
earlier
much
larger
estimates
if
scrutinised
had
no
reliable
basis
It
is
true
that
variable
splicing
means
that
the
number
of
proteins
is
not
limited
to
the
number
of
proteincoding
genes
The
immune
system
generates
the
vast
majority
of
the
individual
proteins
in
our
bodies
but
uses
a
different
splicing
systemat
the
DNA
rather
than
the
RNA
level
In
addition
to
proteins
regions
of
DNA
encode
nonmessenger
RNA
molecules
including
but
not
limited
to
the
RNA
components
of
the
ribosome
and
transfer
RNAs
tRNAs
Nevertheless
the
function
of
the
more
than
99
nonproteincoding
DNA
was
a
mystery
Although
clearly
some
of
the
noncoding
regions
were
regulatory
there
was
still
a
tendency
to
talk
about
the
large
amounts
of
junk
DNA
For
although
the
fugu
fish
genome
is
only
oneeighth
the
size
of
the
human
genome
fugu
has
a
protein
repertoire
of
a
similar
size
to
humans
If
fugu
could
get
along
without
seveneighths
of
our
DNA
the
suggestion
was
that
much
of
this
excess
must
be
junk
Sydney
Brenner
distinguished
junk
meaning
useless
stuff
you
keep
around
from
garbage
or
useless
stuff
you
get
rid
of
There
are
two
ways
for
a
noncoding
region
of
DNA
to
have
a
function
Even
if
not
transcribed
it
could
be
involved
in
sequencedependent
physical
interactions
within
chromatin
that
either
expose
it
to
or
block
it
from
protein
ligands
If
transcribed
it
can
form
RNAs
with
various
possible
functions
the
most
common
of
which
is
regulation
of
transcription
Categories
of
results
of
the
ENCODE
analysis
include
evidence
that
75
of
the
human
genome
is
transcribed

mapping
and
dictionary

in
the

of
the
DNA

such

amount
to
twice
as

as

for

The

of

of
the

The
interactions
that
enhance
or
inhibit
gene
expression
have
a
detailed
and
intricate
logic
including
feedback
loops
Many
interactions
contribute
to
the
ultimate
decision
a
mapping
of
exposed
sites
in
chromatin
which
are
unprotected
from
DNase

cleavage
These
sites
mark
regulatory
regions
typically
adjacent
to
genes
and
provide
sites
for
binding
of
regulators
of
expression
The
data
provided
by
the
ENCODE
project
will
be
the
launching
pad
for
many
future
research
projects
A
colleague
admitted
to
hearing
an
echo
Now
this
is
not
the
end
It
is
not
even
the
beginning
of
the
end
But
it
is
perhaps
the
end
of
the
beginning
In
DNA
the
molecules
comprising
the
alphabet
are
chemically
similar
and
the
structure
of
DNA
33is
to
a
first
approximation
uniform
although
some
DNAprotein
interactions
distort
the
DNA
structure
Proteins
and
structural
RNAs
in
contrast
show
great
variety
in
their
threedimensional
conformation
These
are
necessary
to
support
their
very
diverse
structural
and
functional
roles
The
amino
acid
sequence
of
a
protein
dictates
its
threedimensional
structure
For
each
natural
amino
acid
sequence
there
is
a
unique
stable
native
state
that
under
proper
conditions
is
adopted
spontaneously
see
Box
14
If
a
purified
protein
is
heated
or
otherwise
brought
to
conditions
far
from
the
normal
physiological
environment
it
will
unfold
to
a
disordered
and
biologically
inactive
structure
This
is
why
our
bodies
contain
mechanisms
to
maintain
nearly
constant
internal
conditions
When
normal
conditions
are
restored
protein
molecules
will
generally
readopt
the
native
structure
indistinguishable
from
the
original
state
There
are
important
exceptions
however
Irreversible
denaturation
leading
to
formation
of
insoluble
aggregates
is
most
familiar
to
us
when
we
hardboil
an
egg
Such
aggregates
are
associated
with
many
diseases
including
Alzheimers
disease
and
bovine
spongiform
encephalopathies
such
as
socalled
madcow
disease
The
functions
of
proteins
depend
on
their
adopting
their
native
threedimensional
structure
For
example
the
native
structure
of
an
enzyme
may
have
a
cavity
on
its
surface
that
binds
a
small
molecule
and
juxtaposes
Box

From
one
dimension
to
three
The
spontaneous
folding
of
proteins
to
form
their
native
states
is
the
point
at
which
nature
makes
the
giant
leap
from
the
onedimensional
world
of
gene
and
protein
sequences
to
the
threedimensional
world
that
we
inhabit
There
is
a
paradox
the
translation
of
DNA
sequences
to
amino
acid
sequences
is
very
simple
to
describe
logically
it
is
specified
by
the
genetic
code
The
folding
of
a
polypeptide
chain
into
a
precise
threedimensional
structure
is
very
difficult
to
describe
logically
However
translation
requires
the
immensely
complicated
machinery
of
the
ribosome
tRNAs
and
associated
molecules
but
protein
folding
occurs
spontaneously
see
Plate

The
polypeptide
chain
of
a
protein
folds
spontaneously
into
the
correct

catalytic
residues
Many
regulatory
mechanisms
depend
on
the
binding
of
proteins
to
other
proteins
or
to
DNA
We
thus
have
the
paradigm
DNA

Much

the
organized
activity
of
bioinformatics
has
been
focused
on
the
analysis
of
the
data
related
to
these
processes
Statics
and
dynamics
The
genome
sequence
of
a
cell
and
its
implied
repertoire
of
RNAs
and
proteins
expresses
what
the
cell
could
be
and
could
do
But
cells
make
choices
Dense
logically
integrated
networks
of
control
mechanisms
govern
the
dynamic
state
of
cellular
metabolic
and
transcriptional
activity
See

The
dynamics
of
the
molecular
biology
of
cells
and
organisms
include
levels
higher
than
the
molecular
of
structure
and
organization
Examples
are
such
questions
as
how
tissues
become
specialized
during
development
or
more
generally
how
environmental
effects
exert
control
over
genetic
events
In
some
cases
of
simple
feedback
loops
it
is
understood
at
the
molecular
level
how
increasing
the
amount
of
a
reactant
causes
an
increase
in
the
production
of
an
enzyme
that
catalyses
its
transformation
The
lac
operon
of
Escherichia

is
an
example
More
complex
are
the
programmes
of
development
that
unfold
during
the
lifetime
of

which
must
ultimately
be
reflected

fascinating
problems
about

and

in

have

A
database
without
effective
modes
of
access
is
merely
a
data
graveyard
37Useful
access
to
data
requires
a
set
of
tools
for
answering
questions
such
as
Does
the
database
contain
the
information
I
require
Example
can
I
retrieve
the
amino
acid
sequence
of
human
alcohol
dehydrogenase
How
can
I
assemble
selected
information
from
the
database
in
a
useful
form
Example
compile
a
list
of
globin
sequences
or
even
better
a
table
of
aligned
globin
sequences
Indices
of
databases
are
useful
in
asking
Where
can
I
find
some
specific
piece
of
information
Example
what
databases
contain
the
amino
acid
sequence
of
porcupine
trypsin
Of
course
if
I
know
and
can
specify
exactly
what
I
want
the
problem
is
relatively
straightforward
Mechanisms
that
allow
effective
access
are
an
issue
of
database
design
that
ideally
should
remain
hidden
from
users
It
has
become
clear
that
effective
access
cannot
be
provided
by
bolting
a
query
system
onto
an
unstructured
archive
Instead
the
logical
organization
of
the
storage
of
the
information
must
be
designed
with
the
access
in
mind
considering
what
kinds
of
questions
users
will
want
to
ask
The
structure
of
the
archive
must
mesh
smoothly
with
the
informationretrieval
software
A
variety
of
database
queries
arise
in
bioinformatics
Compare
the
following
typical
examples
1
Given
a
sequence
or
fragment
of
a
sequence
find
sequences
in
the
database
that
are
similar
to
it
This
is
a
central
problem
in
bioinformatics
We
share
such
stringmatching
problems
with
many
fields
of
computer
science
For
instance
word
processing
and
editing
programs
support
string
search
functions
2
Given
a
protein
structure
or
fragment
find
protein
structures
in
the
database
that
are
similar
to
it
This
is
the
generalization
of
the
stringmatching
problem
to
three
dimensions
3
Given
a
sequence
of
a
protein
of
unknown
structure
find
structures
in
the
database
that
adopt
similar
threedimensional
structures
One
might
be
tempted
to
cheat
to
look
in
the
sequence
data
banks
for
proteins
with
sequences
similar
to
the
probe
sequence
For
if
two
proteins
have
sufficiently
similar
sequences
they
will
have
similar
structures
However
the
converse
is
not
true
and
one
can
hope
to
create
more
powerful
search
techniques
that
will
find
proteins
of
similar
structure
even
though
their
sequences
have
diverged
beyond
the
point
where
they
can
be
recognized
as
similar
by
sequence
comparison
4
Given
a
protein
structure
find
sequences
in
the
data
bank
that
correspond
to
similar
structures
Again
one
can
cheat
by
using
the
structure
to
probe
a
structure
data
bank
but
this
can
give
only
limited
success
because
there
are
so
many
more
sequences
known
than
structures
It
is
therefore
desirable
to
have
a
method
that
can
pick
out
the
structure
from
the
sequence
Points
1
and
2
are
solved
problems
such
searches
are
carried
out
thousands
of
times
a
day
Points
3
and
4
are
active
fields
of
research
Information
flow
in
bioinformatics
Data
enter
the
bioinformatics
establishment
when
a
scientist
deposits
an
experimental
result
in
an
archive
or
a
database
records
a
result
appearing
in
the
literature
The
archive
curates
and
annotates
the
data
to
create
an
entry
of
proper
contents
and
format
Quality
checks
are
part
of
the
curation
process
The
new
entry
then
appears
in
the
public
release
of
the
archive
The
division
of
the
archive
into
entries
is
determined
by
the
provenance
of
the
data
that
is
an
entry
corresponds
to
one
coherent
set
of
experimental
measurements
often
corresponding
to
one
38published
article
In
some
cases
fragments
of
a
complete
sequence
appear
in
several
articles
A
database
can
join
the
results
to
form
an
entry
containing
the
complete
biological
entity
Currently
many
nucleotide
sequence
data
sets
enter
the
databases
as
annotated
genomes
or
as
unassembled
metagenomic
fragments
Other
informationretrieval
projects
either
associated
with
an
archive
or
independent
may
integrate
newly
released
entries
into
their
individual
systems
They
may
select
or
reorganize
the
data
structure
and
provide
novel
tools
for
analysis
Reorganization
of
the
data
may
involve
simply
integrating
the
new
entries
into
a
general
or
specialized
search
engine
extracting
useful
subsets
of
the
data
Examples
include
1
identification
of
genes
in
a
connected
DNA
sequence
such
as
a
bacterial
genome
or
a
eukaryotic
chromosome
and
2
the
extraction
of
a
nonredundant
set
of
protein
sequences
to
both
shorten
searches
and
reduce
statistical
bias
deriving
new
types
of
information
from
the
original
data
A
simple
example
release
of
a
protein
coding
gene
by
a
DNA
sequence
archive
will
trigger
the
appearance
of
its
amino
acid
sequence
translation
in
databases
of
protein
sequences
A
notsosimple
aspect
DNA
sequences
dont
tell
us
about
splice
variants
or
about
other
important
information
related
to
the
protein
recombining
data
in
different
ways
Many
projects
group
sequences
or
structures
of
families
of
homologous
proteins
or
proteins
that
share
function
Examples
include
the
MEROPS
protease
database
and
the
Protein
Kinase
Resource
Some
archives
tend
to
keep
related
entries
separate
to
preserve
clarity
of
provenance
Some
databases
integrate
data
about
a
particular
organism
or
sets
of
related
organisms
FlyBase
is
an
example
reannotating
the
data
including
provision
of
different
constellations
of
links
The
integration
may
be
horizontal
or
vertical
That
is
links
may
indicate
relationships
to
other
entries
of
the
same
type
for
instance
correspondences
within
a
genome
among
homologous
genes
or
among
genes
associated
with
the
same
metabolic
pathway
Or
links
may
adduce
a
variety
of
information
about
a
gene
or
protein
for
instance
links
between
a
gene
and
the
clinical
consequences
of
mutations
Many
sites
serve
as
gateways
between
the
archives
and
the
computational
tools
available
for
data
analysis
Information
retrieval
permits
selection
and
extraction
of
data
to
provide
the
ingredients
of
a
research
project
Many
bioinformatics
resources
not
only
offer
information
retrieval
but
facilitate
the
downstream
processing
of
the
entries
selected
A
typical
example
would
be
to
retrieve
the
sequences
of
a
set
of
homologous
genes
and
then
to
align
them
The
goal
is
to
provide
smooth
integration
of
all
the
dataprocessing
steps
required
for
a
research
project
by
intimate
links
among
the
tools
for
data
storage
retrieval
and
analysis
The
growing
importance
of
simultaneous
access
to
databases
has
led
to
research
in
database
interactivity
how
can
databases
talk
to
one
another
without
too
great
a
sacrifice
of
the
freedom
of
each
one
to
structure
its
own
data
in
ways
appropriate
to
the
individual
features
of
the
material
it
contains
On
the
other
hand
there
is
a
very
strong
trend
towards
merging
and
integration
of
data
resources
in
bioinformatics
Some
of
the
reasons
for
this
are
political
the
empirebuilding
allele
is
present
at
fairly
high
frequency
in
the
scientific
population
and
then
the
too
big
to
fail
argument
for
continued
and
enhanced
funding
takes
over
Scientifically
integrating
databases
allows
for
onestop
shopping
makes
for
ease
of
handling
queries
that
require
access
to
different
categories
of
information
and
facilitates
of
crosscategory
consistency
checks
in
curating
the
data
Moreover
large
database
organizations
have
the
personnel
to
provide
tutorial
guides
to
usage
of
the
site
and
to
39present
scientific
background
A
large
organization
can
support
a
help
desk
Frustrated
users
may
retort
that
the
integration
of
the
data
produces
a
site
so
complex
as
to
require
guidance
However
there
are
plenty
of
small
specialized
databases
that
users
also
find
confusing
Indeed
only
national
or
commercial
rivalries
impede
fusion
into
a
single
worldwide
database
Because
of
the
danger
that
the
result
will
prove
unwieldy
it
will
be
possible
to
tailor
access
to
the
needs
of
particular
projects
The
unification
of
the
archives
will
be
accompanied
by
a
fragmentation
of
the
routes
of
access
Although
there
are
good
arguments
for
unique
or
no
more
than
partnership
control
over
the
archives
there
is
no
need
to
limit
the
ways
to
access
them
colloquially
the
design
of
the
front
end
of
the
database
Specialized
user
communities
may
extract
subsets
of
the
data
or
recombine
data
from
different
sources
and
provide
specialized
avenues
of
access
Such
boutique
databases
depend
on
the
primary
archives
as
the
source
of
the
information
they
contain
but
redesign
the
organization
and
presentation
Indeed
different
derived
databases
can
slice
and
dice
the
same
information
in
different
ways
This
accounts
for
much
of
the
great
proliferation
of
specialized
databases
reported
in
the
annual
Nucleic
Acids
Research
compendium
A
reasonable
extrapolation
suggests
the
concept
of
specialized
virtual
databases
a
concept
first
suggested
almost
50
years
ago
grounded
in
the
archives
but
providing
individual
scope
and
function
tailored
to
the
needs
of
individual
research
groups
or
even
individual
scientists
Curation
annotation
and
quality
control
The
scientific
and
medical
communities
are
dependent
on
the
quality
of
databases
Indices
of
quality
even
if
they
do
not
permit
correction
of
mistakes
may
help
us
avoid
arriving
at
wrong
conclusions
Database
entries
comprise
raw
experimental
results
and
supplementary
information
or
annotations
Each
of
these
has
its
own
sources
of
error
The
most
important
determinant
of
the
quality
of
the
data
themselves
is
the
state
of
the
art
of
the
experiments
Older
data
were
limited
by
older
techniques
for
instance
amino
acid
sequences
of
proteins
were
once
determined
by
peptide
sequencing
but
are
now
translated
from
DNA
sequences
except
for
partial
sequencing
by
mass
spectrometry
One
consequence
of
the
data
explosion
is
that
most
data
are
new
data
governed
by
current
technology
which
in
most
cases
does
quite
a
good
job
Annotations
include
information
about
the
source
of
the
data
and
the
methods
used
to
determine
them
They
identify
the
investigators
responsible
and
cite
relevant
publications
They
provide
links
to
related
information
in
other
databases
In
some
sequence
databases
the
annotations
include
feature
tables
which
are
lists
of
segments
of
the
sequences
that
have
biological
significance
for
instance
regions
of
a
DNA
sequence
that
code
for
proteins
These
appear
in
computerparsable
formats
their
contents
restricted
to
a
controlled
vocabulary
Note
that
a
statement
by
each
database
on
a
controlled
vocabulary
and
the
definitions
of
the
terms
that
appear
in
the
vocabulary
is
essential
for
informationretrieval
operations
involving
interactions
among
multiple
databases
and
distributed
queries
This
is
like
a
convention
card
at
a
bridge
tournament
Formerly
a
typical
DNA
sequence
entry
was
produced
by
a
single
research
group
investigating
a
gene
and
its
products
in
a
coherent
way
Annotations
were
grounded
in
experimental
data
and
written
by
specialists
In
contrast
fullgenome
sequencing
projects
offer
no
experimental
confirmation
of
the
expression
of
most
putative
genes
nor
characterization
of
their
products
Curators
at
databases
base
much
of
their
annotation
on
the
analysis
of
the
sequences
by
computer
programs
Annotation
is
the
weakest
component
of
the
genomics
enterprise
Automation
of
annotation
is
possible
only
to
a
limited
extent
getting
it
right
remains
labourintensive
and
allocated
resources
are
40inadequate
But
the
importance
of
proper
annotation
cannot
be
underestimated
P
Bork
has
commented
that
errors
in
gene
assignments
vitiate
the
high
quality
of
the
sequence
data
themselves
Growth
of
genomic
data
will
permit
improvement
in
the
quality
of
annotation
as
statistical
methods
increase
in
accuracy
This
will
allow
improved
reannotation
of
entries
The
improvement
of
annotations
will
be
a
good
thing
It
implies
however
the
disturbing
concomitant
that
annotation
will
be
in
flux
The
problem
is
aggravated
by
the
proliferation
of
websites
with
increasingly
dense
networks
of
links
Networks
of
websites
provide
useful
avenues
for
applications
But
the
web
is
also
a
vector
of
contagion
propagating
errors
in
raw
data
in
immature
data
subsequently
corrected
but
the
corrections
not
passed
on
and
in
variant
annotations
Perhaps
the
only
possible
solution
is
a
distributed
and
dynamic
errorcorrection
and
annotation
process
Distributed
in
that
database
staff
will
have
neither
the
time
nor
the
expertise
for
the
job
specialists
will
have
to
act
as
curators
Dynamic
in
that
progress
in
automation
of
annotation
and
error
identificationcorrection
will
permit
reannotation
of
databases
We
will
have
to
give
up
the
safe
idea
of
a
stable
database
composed
of
entries
that
were
correct
when
first
distributed
and
which
will
stay
fixed
Databases
will
become
a
seething
broth
of
information
growing
in
size
and
maturing
we
must
hopein
quality
Tasks
of
greater
subtlety
arise
when
one
wishes
to
study
relationships
between
information
contained
in
separate
databases
This
requires
links
that
facilitate
simultaneous
access
to
several
databases
Here
is
an
example
for
which
proteins
of
known
structure
involved
in
diseases
of
purine
biosynthesis
in
humans
are
there
related
proteins
in
yeast
We
are
setting
conditions
on
known
structure
specified
function
detection
of
relatedness
correlation
with
disease
and
specified
species
Today
the
quality
of
a
database
depends
not
only
on
the
information
it
contains
but
on
the
effectiveness
of
its
links
to
other
related
sources
of
information
This
one
of
the
reasons
for
integration
of
databases
The

All

will
have
used
the
worldwide

for
reference
material
for

for
access
to
databases
in
molecular
biology
for
checking
out
personal

just
for

The
web
is
a
means
of
interpersonal
and
intercomputer
contact
over
networks
It
provides
a
complete
global
village
containing
the
equivalent
of
library
post
office
shops
and
schools
As
a
repository
the
web
can
be
thought
of
as
a
giant
worldwide
multimedia
notice
board
It
contains
text
images
cinema
and
sound
Virtually
anything
that
can
be
stored
on
a
computer
can
be
made
available
and
accessed
via
the
web
An
interesting
example
is
a
site
treating
the
poetry
of
Walt
Whitman
httpwwwwhitmanarchiveorg
The
highestlevel
page
contains
a
table
of

The
site
contains
printed

of
different
poems
You
can
compare
different
editions
You
can
access
critical
analysis
of
the
poems
You
can
see
versions
of
some
poems
in

There
is
even
a
link
to
an
audio
file
from
which
you
can
hear
Whitman
himself
reading
part
of
a

Links
embedded
in
a

can
be
internal

Internal
links
take
you
to
other
portions
of
the
text
of
a
current

External

may
allow
you
to
move

perhaps
providing

sideways
to
parallel

other

or
over

that

Submitting
a
BLAST
search
A
BLAST
search
is
a
common
and
typical
example
of
the
use
of
a
web
server
in
bioinformatics
Pointing
a
browser
at
a
web
server
one
can
paste
in
a
sequence
of
interest
choose
options
and
submit
the
calculation
Subsequently
the
result
will
appear
in
the
window
The
calculation
is
done
remotely
If
you
are
using
the
BLAST
server
at
the
EBI
httpwwwebiacukToolssssncbiblastnucleotidehtml
the
computations
will
be
done
at
a

most
but
not
all
are
BLAST
searches
Currently
the
EBI
dedicates
a
216node
cluster
to
this
service
Very
soon
we
shall
examine
the
results
of
such
a
search
in
detail
The
main
thing
to
do
to
get
started
using
the
web
effectively
is
to
find
useful
entry
points
Once
a
session
is
launched
links
will
take
you
where
you
want
to
go
Among
the
most
important
sites
are
search
engines
such
as
Google
that
index
the
entire
web
and
permit
retrieval
by
keywords
You
can
enter
one
or
more
terms
such
as
phosphorylase
allosteric
change
or
crystal
structure
and
the
search
program
will
return
a
list
of
links
to
sites
on
the
web
that
contain
these
terms
Once
you
have
completed
a
successful
session
when
you
next
log
in
the
intersession
memory
facilities
of
the
browsers
allow
you
to
pick
up
cleanly
where
you
left
off
During
any
session
should
you
find
yourself
viewing
a
document
to
which
you
will
want
to
return
you
can
save
the
link
in
a
file
of
bookmarks
or
favourites
In
a
subsequent
session
you
can
return
directly
to
any
site
on
this
list
not
needing
to
follow
the
trail
of
links
that
led
you
there
in
the
first
place
A
personal
home
page
is
a
short
autobiographical
sketch
with
links
of
course
You
and
your
colleagues
will
have
your
own
home
pages
which
typically
include
name
institutional
affiliation
addresses
for
paper
and
electronic
mail
telephone
and
fax
numbers
a
list
of
publications
and
current
research
interests
It
is
not
uncommon
for
home
pages
to
include
personal
information
such
as
hobbies
pictures
of
the
individual
with
his
or
her
spouse
and
children
and
even
with
the
family
dog
It
is
important
however
not
to
include
information
that
would
create
vulnerability
to
identity
theft
Electronic
publication
We
are
in
an
era
of
a
transition
to
paperfree
publishing
More
and
more
publications
are
appearing
on
the
web
A
scientific
journal
may
post
only
its
table
of
contents
or
a
table
of
contents
together
with
abstracts
of
articles
or
complete
articles
Many
institutional
publicationsnewsletters
and
technical
reportsappear
on
the
web
Many
other
magazines
and
newspapers
are
showing
up
as
well
You
might

to
try
httpwwwnytimescom
Many
printed
publications
now
contain
references
to
web
links
containing
supplementary
material
that
never
appears
on
paper
Major
forces
in
the
conversion
of
paper
to
electronic

are
the
advent
of
electronicformat
only
journals
and
Googles
project
to

of
a

42Computers
and
computer
science
Bioinformatics
would
not
be
possible
without
advances
in
computing
hardware
and
software
Fast
and
highcapacity
storage
media
are
essential
even
to
maintain
the
archives
Information
retrieval
and
analysis
require
programs
some
fairly
straightforward
and
others
extremely
sophisticated
Distribution
of
the
information
requires
the
facilities
of
computer
networks
and
the
worldwide
web
Computer
science
is
a
relatively
young
and
flourishing
field
with
the
goal
of
making
the
most
effective
use
of
information
technology
hardware
Certain
areas
of
computer
science
impinge
most
directly
on
bioinformatics
Consider
their
application
to
a
specific
biological
problem
that
of
retrieving
from
a
database
all
sequences
similar
to
the
human
PAX6
sequence
A
good
solution
to
this
problem
would
appeal
to
computer
science
for
Analysis
of
algorithms
An
algorithm
is
a
complete
and
precise
specification
of
a
method
for
solving
a
problem
For
the
retrieval
of
similar
sequences
we
need
to
measure
the
similarity
of
the
probe
sequence
to
every
sequence
in
the
database
It
is
possible
to
do
much
better
than
the
naive
approach
of
checking
every
pair
of
positions
in
every
possible
juxtaposition
a
method
that
even
without
allowing
gaps
would
require
a
time
proportional
to
the
product
of
the
number
of
characters
in
the
probe
sequence
times
the
number
of
characters
in
the
database
A
speciality
in
computer
science
known
colloquially
as
stringology
focuses
on
developing
efficient
methods
for
this
type
of
problem
and
analysing
their
effective
performance
Data
structures
and
information
retrieval
How
can
we
organize
our
data
for
efficient
response
to
queries
For
instance
are
there
ways
to
index
or
otherwise
preprocess
the
data
to
make
our
sequencesimilarity
searches
more
efficient
How
can
we
provide
interfaces
that
will
assist
the
user
in
framing
and
executing
queries
Software
engineering
Hardly
ever
anymore
does
anyone
write
programs
in
the
native
language
of
computers
Programmers
work
in
higherlevel
languages
such
as
C
C
PERL
PYTHON
JAVA
or
even
FORTRAN
The
choice
of
programming
language
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
algorithm
and
associated
data
structure
and
the
expected
use
of
the
program
Of
course
most
complicated
software
used
in
bioinformatics
is
now
written
by
specialists
which
brings
up
the
question
of
how
much
programming
expertise
a
bioinformatician
needs
Programming
Programming
is
to
computer
science
what
bricklaying
is
to
architecture
Both
are
creative
one
is
an
art
and
the
other
a
craft
Many
students
of
bioinformatics
ask
whether
it
is
essential
to
learn
to
write
complicated
computer
programs
My
advice
not
agreed
upon
by
everyone
in
the
field
is
Dont
Unless
you
want
to
specialize
in
it
To
work
in
bioinformatics
you
will
need
to
develop
expertise
in
using
tools
available
on
the
web
Learning
how
to
create
and
maintain
a
website
is
essential
And
of
course
you
will
need
facility
in
the
use
of
the
your
computers
operating
system
including
generalpurpose
application
programs
such
as
word
processors
and
presentation
tools
Some
skill
in
writing
simple
scripts
in
a
language
like
PERL
provides
an
essential
extension
to
the
basic
facilities
of
the
operating
system
On
the
other
hand
the
size
of
the
data
archives
and
the
growing
sophistication
of
the
questions
we
wish
to
address
demand
respect
Truly
creative
programming
in
the
field
is
best
left
to
specialists
with
advanced
training
in
computer
science
Nor
does
using
programs
via
highly
polished
not
to
43say
flashy
web
interfaces
provide
any
indication
of
the
nature
of
the
activity
involved
in
writing
and
debugging
programs
Bismarck
once
said
Those
who
love
sausages
or
the
law
should
not
watch
either
being
made
Perhaps
computer
programs
should
be
added
to
his
list
I
recommend
learning
some
basic
skills
with
PERL
or
with
one
of
the
related
languages
PYTHON
or
RUBY
PERL
is
a
very
powerful
tool
and
is
available
for
all
computer
systems
PERL
makes
it
very
easy
to
carry
out
many
very
useful
simple
tasks
but
can
also
be
effective
in
projects
demanding
heavy
computation
How
should
you
learn
enough
PERL
to
be
useful
in
bioinformatics
Many
institutions
run
courses
Learning
from
colleagues
is
fine
depending
on
the
ratio
of
your
aptitude
to
their
patience
Books
are
available
A
very
useful
approach
is
to
find
lessons
on
the
web
ask
a
search
engine
for
PERL
tutorial
and
you
will
turn
up
many
useful
sites
that
will
lead
you
by
the
hand
through
the
basics
And
of
course
use
it
as
much
as
you
can
This
book
will
not
teach
you
PERL
but
it
will
provide
opportunities
to
practise
what
you
learn
elsewhere
Should
your
programming
ambitions
go
beyond
simple
tasks
check
out
the
BioPERL
project
a
source
of
freely
available
PERL
programs
and

in
the

of
bioinformatics

The

of
PERL

is
a
very

Three
types
of

The

of
input
data
referred

as
line
is
a
simple
character
string
It
is
split
into
an
array
or
vector
of

An
array
stores
several
items
in
a
linear
order
and
individual
items
of
data
can
be
retrieved
from
their
positions
in
the
array
Then
for
ease
of
looking
up
the
amino
acid
coded

the
genetic
code
is

as
an
associative
array
An
associative
array
or
hash
table
is
a
generalization
of
a
simple
or
sequential
45array
Elements
of
a
simple
array
are
indexed
by
consecutive
integers
Elements
of
an
associative
array
are
indexed
by
any
character
strings
in
this
case
the
64
triplets
We
utilize
the
input
triplets
in
order
of
their
appearance
in
the
nucleotide
sequence
but
we
need
to
access
the
elements
of
the
genetic
code
table
in
an
arbitrary
order
as
dictated
by
the
succession
of
triplets
in
the
input
data
A
simple
array
or
vector
of
character
strings
is
appropriate
for
processing
successive
triplets
and
the

is
appropriate
for
looking

Biological
classification
and
nomenclature
Back
to
the
eighteenth
century
when
academic
life
was
simpler
at
least
in
some
respects
Biological
nomenclature
is
based
on
the
idea
that
living
things
are
divided
into
units
called
species
groups
of
similar
organisms
with
a
common
gene
pool
Why
living
things
should
be
quantized
into
discrete
species
is
a
very
complicated
question

Swedish
naturalist
classified
living
things
according
to
a
hierarchy
kingdom
phylum
class
order
family
genus
and
species
Modern
taxonomists
have
added
additional
levels
For
identification
it
generally
suffices
to
specify
the
binomial
genus
and
species
for
instance
Homo
sapiens
for
human
or
Drosophila
melanogaster
for
fruit
fly
Each
binomial
uniquely
specifies
a
species
that
may
also
be
known
by
one
or
more
common
names
for
instance
Bos
taurus
cow
Of
course
most
species
have
no
common
names

Originally
the
Linnaean
system
was
only
a
classification
based
on
observed
similarities
Once
evolution
was
understood
it
emerged
that
the
system
largely
reflects
biological
ancestry
But
which
similarities
truly
reflect
common
ancestry
Characteristics
derived
from
a
common
ancestor
are
homologous
for
instance
an
eagles
wing
and
a
humans
arm
Other
apparently
similar
characteristics
may
have
arisen
independently
by
convergent
evolution
for
instance
an
eagles
wing
and
a
bees
wing
the
most
recent
common
ancestor
of
eagles
and
bees
did
not
have
wings
Conversely
truly
homologous
characters
may
have
diverged
to
become
very
dissimilar
in
structure
and
function
The
bones
of
our
middle
ears
are
homologous
to
bones
in
the
jaws
of
primitive
fishes
our
eustachian
tubes
are
homologues
of
gill
slits
In
most
cases
experts
can
distinguish
true
homologies
from
similarities
resulting
from
convergent
evolution
Sequence
analysis
gives
the
most
unambiguous
evidence
for
the
relationships
among
species
The
system
works
well
for
higher
organisms
for
which
sequence
analysis
and
the
classical
tools
of
comparative
anatomy
palaeontology
and
embryology
usually
give
a
consistent
picture
48Classification
of
microorganisms
is
more
difficult
partly
because
it
is
less
obvious
how
to
select
the
features
on
which
to
classify
them
and
partly
because
a
large
amount
of
lateral
gene
transfer
threatens
to
overturn
the
picture
entirely
Ribosomal
RNAs
rRNAs
turned
out
to
have
the
essential
feature
of
being
present
in
all
organisms
with
the
right
degree
of
divergence
Too
much
or
too
little
divergence
and
relationships
become
invisible
as
is
apparent
when
looking
into
phylogenetic
relationships
among
elephants
and
mammoths

A

reveals
emphasis
on
bacteria
because
of
their
clinical
importance
and
for
the
relative
ease
of

of
prokaryotes
However
despite
the
obvious
differences
in

and
the

of

Archaea
are
in
some
ways
more
closely
related
on

logic
really
the
other
way
round
Lets
try
a
hard
one
are
mammoths
more
closely

to
Indian
or
African

We
know
that
African
and
Indian
elephants
and
mammoths
must
be
close
relatives
just
look
at
them
But
could
we
tell
from
these
sequences
alone
that
they
are
from
closely
related
species
Given
that
the
differences
are
so
few
do
they
represent
true
evolutionary
divergence
or
merely
random
noise
or
drift
As
background
to
such
questions
let
us
reemphasize
the
distinction
between
similarity
and
53homology
Similarity
is
the
observation
or
measurement
of
resemblance
and
difference
independent
of
the
source
of
the
resemblance
Homology
means
specifically
that
the
sequences
and
the
organisms
in
which
they
occur
are
descended
from
a
common
ancestor
with
the
implication
that
the
similarities
are
shared
ancestral
characteristics
Similarity
of
sequences
or
of
macroscopic
biological
characters
is
observable
in
data
collectable
now
and
involves
no
historical
hypotheses
In
contrast
assertions
of
homology
are
statements
of
historical
events
that
are
almost
always
unobservable
Homology
must
be
an
inference
from
observations
of
similarity
Only
in
a
few
cases
is
homology
directly

The
assertion
that
the
haemoglobin
chains
from
African
and
Indian
elephants
and
mammoths
are
homologous
means
that
there
was
a
common
ancestor
presumably
containing
a
unique
haemoglobin
chain
that
by
alternative
mutations
gave
rise
to
the
proteins
of
mammoths
and
modern
elephants
Is
the
very
high
degree
of
similarity
of
the
sequences
proof
that
they
are
homologous
or
are
there
other
possible
explanations
It
might
be
that
a
functional
haemoglobin
chain
requires
so
many
conserved
residues
that
54haemoglobins
from
all
animals
must
be
as
similar
to
one
another
as
the
elephant
and
mammoth
proteins
are
whether
or
not
they
are
homologues
We
can
test
this
by
looking
at
haemoglobin
chain
sequences
from
other
species
The
result
is
that
the
corresponding
sequences
from
other
animals
differ
substantially
from
those
of
elephants
and
mammoths
A
second
possibility
is
that
there
are
special
physiological
requirements
for
a
haemoglobin
chain
to
function
well
in
an
animal
with
the
size
and
form
of
an
elephant
that
the
three
sequences
started
out
from
independent
ancestors
and
that
common
selective
pressures
forced
them
to
become
similar
Remember
that
we
are
asking
what
can
be
deduced
from
these
sequences
alone
The
mammoth
may
be
more
closely
related
to
the
African
elephant
but
since
the
time
of
the
last
common
ancestor
the
haemoglobin
chain
sequence
of
the
African
elephant
may
have
evolved
faster
than
that
of
the
Indian
elephant
or
the
mammoth
accumulating
more
mutations
A
fourth
hypothesis
is
that
all
common
ancestors
of
elephants
and
mammoths
had
very
dissimilar
sequences
but
that
living
elephants
and
mammoths
gained
a
common
gene
by
transfer
from
a
species
in
some
other
family
via
a
virus
Suppose
however
that
we
are
satisfied
that
the
similarity
of
the
elephant
and
mammoth
sequences
is
high
enough
to
imply
homology
what
then

the

sequences

Are
the
larger

can
we
answer

questions

The
question
of
whether
mammoths
are
closer
to
African
or
Indian
elephants
was
decided
only
recently
in
favour
of
African
elephants
Since
then
expert

that
of
some
of
the
same
expertshas
shifted
to
the
conclusion
that
Indian
elephants
are
the
closest
extant
relatives
of
mammoths
Why
has
this
question
proved
so
difficult
It
reflects
the
limited
power
of
our
tools
applied
to
the
available
data
to
resolve

that
happened
very

The
three
major
groups
of
elephants
are
African
elephants
Asian
elephants
and
mammoths
These
taxa
comprise
a
family
the
Elephantidae
containing
three
main
genera
Loxodonta
including
the
African
species
L
africana
Elephas
including
the
Asian
species
E

and
Mammuthus
including
the
Siberian
species
M
primigenius
At
the
family
level
in
our
lineage
humans
chimpanzees
gorillas
and
orangutans
comprise
the
hominidae
The
genera
in
the
family
Elephantidae
diverged
about
6
million
years
ago
in
Africa
at
approximately
the
same
time
as
the
divergence
of
human
and
chimpanzee
ancestors

However
our

The
challenging
phylogenetic
problem
is
to
determine
the
branching
order
of
Asian
and
African
elephants
and
mammoths
Which
group
split
off
first
It
took
only
500
000
years
to
establish
the
three
lineages
The
shortness
of
this
time
makes
great
demands
on
our
analytical
tools
Other
factors
that
make
the
identification
of
the
true
branching
pattern
difficult
include
is
the
sequence
of
a
close
relative
available
to
serve
for
comparison
as
an
outgroup
The
earliest
work
on
the
mammoth
genome
used
dugong
or
hyrax
as
the
outgroup
These
diverged
from
55elephants
65
million
years
ago
Sequences
from
the
American
mastodon
Mammut
americanum
have
provided
a
more
suitable
outgroup
in
recent
investigations
small
population
sizes
may
increase
the
importance
of
fluctuations
the
assumption
of
constant
rates
of
evolution
in
the
different
lineages
may
be
unjustified
Current
data
and
analysis
suggest
that
mammoths
are
more
closely
related
to
Asian
elephants
Despite
the
difficulty
of
the
elephantmammoth
problem
analysis
of
sequence
similarities
in
genomes
and
proteins
is
now
sufficiently
well
established
that
it

Mammoth

shape
ideas
about

Cuvier
himself
first
distinguished
the
African
Asian
and
mammoth
lineages
in
a
1796
paper
Cuvier
accepted
the
idea
that
species
could
become
extinct
a
prerequisite
to
development
of
ideas
about
evolution
Many
contemporaries
believed
instead
in
the
immutability
of
species
US
President
Thomas

was
one
He

Meriwether

of

for
living
mammoths
establishing
phylogenetic
relationships
even
though
sometimes
the
results
may
not
be
significant
and
in
other
cases
they
even
give
incorrect
answers
Except

to

there
are
copious
data

effective
tools
for

what
is
necessary
to

a

and
powerful
analytical
tools
None
of
this
replaces
the
need
for
thoughtful
scientific
judgement
Use
of
SINES
and
LINES
to
derive
phylogenetic
relationships
Major
problems
with
inferring
phylogenies
from
comparisons
of
gene
and
protein
sequences
are
1
the
wide
range
of
variation
of
similarity
which
may
dip
below
statistical
significance
and
2
the
effects
of
different
rates
of
evolution
along
different
branches
of
the
evolutionary
tree
In
many
cases
even
if
sequence
similarities
confidently
establish
relationships
it
may
be
very
difficult
or
impossible
to
decide
the
order
in
which
sets
of
taxa
have
split
The
Elephantidae
are
an
example
The
phylogeneticists
dreamfeatures
that
have
an
allornone
character
the
appearance
of
which
is
irreversible
so
that
the
order
of
branching
events
can
be
decidedis
in
some
cases
afforded
by
certain
noncoding
sequences
in
genomes
Short
and
long
interspersed
nuclear
elements
or
SINES
and
LINES
are
repetitive
noncoding
sequences
that
form
large
fractions
of
eukaryotic
genomes
that
is
at
least
30
of
human
chromosomal
DNA
and
over
50
of
some
higher
plant
genomes
Typically
SINES
are
70500
base
pairs
long
and
up
to
10
6
copies
may
appear
LINES
may
be
up
to
7000
base
pairs
long
and
up
to
10
5
copies
may
appear
SINES
enter
the
genome
by
reverse
transcription
of
RNA
Most
SINES
contain
a
5
region
homologous
to
tRNA
a
central
region
unrelated
to
tRNA
and
a
3
ATrich
region
Features
of
SINES
that
make
them
useful
for
phylogenetic
studies
include
the
following
A
SINE
is
either
present
or
absent
Presence
of
a
SINE
at
any
particular
position
is
a
property
that
entails
no
complicated
and
variable
measure
of
similarity
SINES
are
inserted
at
random
in
the
noncoding
portion
of
a
genome
Therefore
appearance
of
56similar
SINES
at
the
same
locus
in
two
species
implies
that
the
species
share
a
common
ancestor
in
which
the
insertion
event
occurred
No
analogue
of
convergent
evolution
muddies
this
picture
because
there
is
no
selection
for
the
site
of
insertion
SINE
insertion
appears
to
be
irreversible
no
mechanism
for
loss
of
SINES
is
known
other
than
rare
largescale
deletions
or
translocations
that
include
the
SINE
site
Therefore
if
two
species
share
a
SINE
at
a
common
locus
absence
of
this
SINE
in
a
third
species
implies
that
the
first
two
species
must
be
more
closely
related
to
each
other
than
either
is
to
the
third
Not
only
do
SINES
show
relationships
they
imply
which
species
branched
off
first
The
last
common
ancestor
of
species
containing
a
common
SINE
must
have
come
after
the
last
common
ancestor
linking
these
species
and
another
that
lacks
this
SINE
N
Okada
and
colleagues
applied
SINE
sequences
to
questions
of
phylogeny
Whales
like
Australians
are
mammals
that
have
adopted
an
aquatic
lifestyle
But
whatin
the
case
of
the
whalesare
their
closest
landbased
relatives
Classical
palaeontology
linked
the
order
Cetaceacomprising
whales
dolphins
and
porpoiseswith
the
order
Artiodactyla
the
eventoed
ungulates
including
cows
and
sheep
for
instance
Cetaceans
were
thought
to
have
diverged
before
the
common
ancestor
of
the
three
extant
artiodactyl
suborders
Suiformes
pigs
Tylopoda
including
camels
and
llamas
and
Ruminantia
including
deer
cows
goats
sheep
antelopes
giraffes
etc
To
place
cetaceans
properly
among
these
groups
several
studies
were
carried
out
with
DNA
sequences
Comparisons
of
mitochondrial
DNA
and
genes
for
pancreatic
ribonuclease
fibrinogen
and
other
proteins
suggested
that
the
closest
relatives
of
the
whales
are
hippopotamuses
and
that
cetaceans
and
hippopotamuses
form
a
separate
group
within
the
artiodactyls
most
closely
related
to
the
Ruminantia
Analysis
of
SINES
confirms
this
relationship
Several
SINES
are
common
to
Ruminantia
hippopotamuses
and
cetaceans
Four
SINES
appear
in
hippopotamuses
and
cetaceans
only
These
observations
imply

phylogenetic
tree
shown
in

the

in

Searching
for
similar
sequences
in
databases
PSIBLAST
A
common
theme
of
the
examples
we
have
treated
is
the
search
of
a
database
for
items
similar
to
a
probe
For
instance
if
you
are
studying
a
novel
gene
or
if
you
identify
within
the
human
genome
a
gene
responsible
for
some
disease
you
will
wish
to
determine
whether
related
genes
appear
in
other
species
The
ideal
method
is
both
sensitive
that
is
it
picks
up
even
very
distant
relationshipsand
selective
that
is
all
the
relationships
that
it
reports
are
true

A
powerful
tool
for
searching
sequence
databases
with
a

sequence
is
PSIBLAST
from
the
NCBI
PSIBLAST
stands
for
Position
Specific
Iterated
Basic
Local
Alignment
Search
Tool
A
previous
program
BLAST
worked
by
identifying
local
regions
of
similarity
without
gaps
and
then
piecing
them
together
The
PSI
in
PSIBLAST
refers
to
enhancements
that
identify
patterns
within
the
sequences
at
preliminary
stages
of
the
database
search
and
then
progressively
refine
them
Recognition
of
conserved
patterns
can
sharpen
both
the
selectivity
and
sensitivity
of
the
search
PSI
BLAST
involves
a
repetitive
or
iterative
process
as
the
emergent
pattern
becomes
better
defined
in
successive
stages
of
the

Sensitivity
and
selectivity
Database
search
methods
involve
a
tradeoff
between
sensitivity
and
selectivity
Does
the
method
find
all
or
most
of
the
examples
that
are
actually
present
or
does
it
miss
a
large
fraction
Conversely
how
many
of
the
hits
that
it
reports
are
incorrect
Suppose
a
database
contains
1000
globin
sequences
and
that
a
search
of
this
database
for
globins
reported
900
results
700
of
which
were
really
globin
sequences
and
200
of
which
were
not
This
result
would
be
said
to
have
300
false
negatives
misses
and
200
false
positives
There
is
a
tradeoff
between
sensitivity
and
selectivity
lowering
a
tolerance
threshold
will
increase
the
numbers
of
both
false
negatives
and
false
positives
Often
one
is
willing
to
work
with
low
thresholds
to
be
sure
of
not
missing
anything
that
might
be
important
but
this
requires
detailed
examination
of
the
results
to
eliminate
the
false
positives

The
eyes
of

human

octopus
are
very
different
in

Conventional
wisdom
noting
the
immense
selective
advantage
conferred
by
the
ability
to
see
held
that
eyes
arose
independently
in
different
phyla
It
therefore
came
as
a
great
surprise
that
a
gene
controlling
human
eye
development
has
a
homologue
governing
eye
development
in
Drosophila
The
PAX6
gene
was
first
cloned
in

human
It
is
a
master
regulatory
gene
controlling
a
complex

The
PAX6

the
eyeless
genehas
a
similar
function
of
control
over
eye
development
Flies
mutated
in
this
gene

eyes
conversely
expression
of
this
gene

The
Drosophila
eyeless

was
first
described
in

Little
did
anyone
then
suspect
a
relation
to
a
mammalian
gene
Not
only
are
the
insect
and
mammalian
genes
similar
in
sequence
they
are
so
closely
related
that
their
function
crosses
species
boundaries
Expression
of
the
mouse
PAX6
gene
in
the
fly
causes
ectopic
eye
development
just
as
expression
of
the
flys
own
eyeless

does
It
should
not
however
be
thought
that
eye
development
is
under
the
control
of
a
single
gene
The
expression
of
mouse
PAX6
in
the

triggers
a
complex
cascade
of

PAX6
has
homologues
in

and
mismatches
distributed
randomly
through
the
sequences
There
is
an
elusive
concept
the
texture
of
an
alignment
that
you
will
become
sensitive
to
The
court
of
last
resort
is
whether
the
structures
are
similar
but
often
this
information
is
not
available
Note
that
if
there
are
many
sequences
in
the
database
that
are
very
similar
to
the
probe
sequence
they
will
head
the
list
In
this
example
there
are
many
very
similar
PAX
genes
in
other
mammals
You
may
have
to
scan
far
down
the
list
to
find
a
distant
relative
that
you
consider
to
be
interesting
Even
in
the
case
of
Drosophila
eyeless
a
very
close
relative
of
the
probe
sequence
the
program
reports
only
a
local
match
to
a
portion
of
the
sequences
The
full
alignment
is
shown
in
the
box
entitled
Complete

Results
of
a
PSIBLAST
search
for
human
PAX6
protein
One
iteration
of
PSIBLAST
was
run
using
human
PAX6
as
the
query
sequence
searching
the
nonredundant
nr
database
The
NCBI
nr
database
is
a
set
of
unique
sequences
selected
from
the
full
databases
to
eliminate
multiple
hits
to
very
similar

The

contains
a

of

A

The

makes
use
of
PERLs
rich
patternrecognition
resources
to
search
for
character
strings
of
the
form
Drosophila

We
want
to
specify
the
following
pattern
a
square
bracket
followed
by
a
word
beginning
with
an
uppercase
letter
followed
by
a
variable
number
of
lowercase
letters
then
a
space
between
words
then
a
word
all
in
lowercase
letters
then
a
closing
square
bracket
This
kind
of
pattern
is
called
a
regular

and
appears
in
the
PERL
program
in
the
following
form
AZaz

Building

the

specify

lowercase
letters
and
combine
the
results
AZaz
az
an

followed
by

or
more

letters
the
genus
name
followed
by
a
blank
followed
by
one
or
more
lowercase
letters
the
species
name
Enclosing
these
in
parentheses
AZaz
az
tells
PERL
to
save
the
material
that
matched
the
pattern
for
future
reference
In
PERL
this
matched
material
is
designated
by
the
variable
1
Thus
if
the

contained

the
statement

would
effectively
be

Finally

brackets
surrounding
the
genus
and
species
name
but
brackets
signify
character
ranges
Therefore
we
must
precede
the
brackets
by
backslashes
to
give
the
final

The
use
of
the
associative
array
to
retain
only
a
unique
set
of
species
is
another
instructive
aspect
of
the
program
Recall
that
an
associative
array
is
a
generalization
of
an
ordinary
array
or
vector
in
which
the
elements
are
not
indexed
by
integers
but
by
arbitrary
strings
A
second
reference
to
an
associative
array
with
a
previously
encountered
index
string
could
change
the
value
in
the
array
but
not
the
list
of
index
strings
In
this
case
we
do
not
care
about
the
value
but
just
use
the
index
strings
to
compile
a
unique
list
of
species
detected
Multiple
references
to
the
same
species
will
merely
overwrite
the
first
reference
not
make
a
repetitive
list
The
set
of
indices
or
keys
in
the
associated
array
species
collects
the
names
of
the
species
found
Newer
versions
of
PSIBLAST
report
the
taxonomic
distribution
of
the
hits
However
the
program
in
this
example
would
be
useful
if
one
wanted
to
retrieve
the
alignments
or
perform
other
types
of
analysis
on
the
results
Would
the
program
handle
correctly
identifiers
containing
subspecies

66Introduction
to
protein
structure
With
protein
structures
we
leave
behind
the
onedimensional
world
of
nucleotide
and
amino
acid
sequences
and
enter
the
spatial
world
of
molecular
structures
Some
of
the
facilities
for
archiving
and
retrieving
molecular
biological
information
survive
this
change
pretty
well
intact
some
must
be
substantially
altered
and
others
do
not
make
it
at
all
Biochemically
proteins
play
a
variety
of
roles
in
life
processes
there
are
structural
proteins
for
example
viral
coat
proteins
the
horny
outer
layer
of
human
and
animal
skin
and
proteins
of
the
cytoskeleton
proteins
that
catalyse
chemical
reactions
the
enzymes
transport
and
storage
proteins
haemoglobin
regulatory
proteins
including
hormones
and
receptorsignal
transduction
proteins
proteins
that
control
gene
transcription
and
proteins
involved
in
recognition
including
cell
adhesion
molecules
and
antibodies
and
other
proteins
of
the
immune
system
Proteins
are
large
molecules
In
many
cases
only
a
small
part
of
the
structurean
active
site
is
directly
functional
the
rest
existing
only
to
create
and
fix
the
spatial
relationship
among
the
active
site
residues
Proteins
evolve
by
structural
changes
produced
by
mutations
in
the
amino
acid
sequence
and
genetic
rearrangements
that
bring
together
different
combinations
of
structural
subunits
Approximately
100
000
protein
structures
are
now
known
Most
were
determined
by
Xray
crystallography
or
nuclear
magnetic
resonance
NMR
From
these
we
have
derived
our
understanding
both
of
the
functions
of
individual
proteinsfor
example
the
chemical
explanation
of
catalytic
activity
of
enzymesand
of
the
general
principles
of
protein
structure
and
folding
Chemically
protein
molecules
are
long
polymers
typically
containing
several
thousand
atoms
composed
of
a
uniform
repetitive
backbone
or
mainchain
with
a
particular
sidechain
attached
to
each
residue
see
Fig
16
The
amino
acid
sequence
of
a
protein
records
the
succession
of
sidechains
The
polypeptide
chain
folds
into
a
curve
in
space
the
course
of
the
chain
defines
a
folding
pattern
Proteins
show
a
great
variety
of
folding
patterns
Underlying
these
are
a
number
of
common
structural
features
These
include
the
recurrence
of
explicit
structural
paradigmsfor
example
helices
and
sheets
Fig
17
and
common
principles
or
features
such
as
the
dense
packing
of
the
atoms
in
protein
interiors
Folding
may
be
thought
of
as
a
kind
of
intramolecular
condensation
or
crystallization
The
hierarchical
nature
of
protein
architecture
The
Danish
protein
chemist
KU
LinderstrmLang
described
the
following
levels
of
protein
structure
The
amino
acid
sequencethe
set
of
primary
chemical
bondsis
called
the
primary
structure
The
assignment
of
helices
and
sheetsthe
hydrogenbonding
pattern
of
the
mainchainis
called
the
secondary
structure
The
assembly
and
interactions
of
the
helices
and
sheets
is
called
the
tertiary
structure
For
proteins
composed
of
more
than
one
subunit
JD
Bernal
called
the
assembly
of
the
monomers
the
quaternary
structure
In
some
cases
evolution
can
merge
proteins
changing
quaternary
to
tertiary
structure
For
example
five
separate
enzymes
in
the
bacterium
E
coli
that
catalyse
successive
steps
in
the
pathway
of
biosynthesis
of
aromatic
amino
acids
underwent
a
gene
fusion
These
separate
genes
in
E
coli
correspond
to
five
regions
of
a
single
protein
in
the
fungus
67Aspergillus
nidulans
Sometimes
homologous
monomers
form
oligomers
in
different
ways
for
instance
globins
form
tetramers
in
mammalian
haemoglobins
and
dimersusing
a
different
interfacein
the
ark
clam
Scapharca
inaequivalvis
It
has
proved
useful
to
add
additional
levels
to
the
hierarchy
as
follows
Supersecondary
structures
Proteins
show
recurrent
patterns
of
interaction
between
helices
and
sheets
close
together
in
the
sequence
These
supersecondary
structures
include
the
helix
hairpin
the
hairpin
and
the
unit
Fig
18
Domains
Many
proteins
contain
compact
units
within
the
folding
pattern
of
a
single
chain
that
look
as
if
they
should
have
independent
stability
These
are
called
domains
Do
not
confuse
domains
as
substructures
of
proteins
with
domains
as
general
classes
of
living
things
Archaea
Bacteria
and
Eukarya
The
RNAbinding
protein
L1
Fig
19
has
features
typical
of
multidomain
proteins
the
binding
site
appears
in
a
cleft
between
the
two
domains
and
the
relative
geometry
of
the
two
domains
is
flexible
allowing
ligandinduced
conformational
changes
In
the
hierarchy
domains
fall
between
supersecondary
structures
and
the
tertiary
structure
of
a
complete
monomer
Modular
proteins
Modular
proteins
are
multidomain
proteins
that
often
contain
many
copies
of
closely
related
domains
Domains
recur
in
many
proteins
in
different
structural
contexts
that
is
different
modular
proteins
can
mix
and
match
sets
of
domains
For
example
fibronectin
a
large
extracellular
protein
involved
in
cell
adhesion
and
migration
contains
29
domains
including
multiple
tandem
repeats
of
three
types
of
domain
called
F1
F2
and
F3
It
is
a
linear
array
of
the
form

Classification
of

The

of
families
of
protein
structures
is
based
on
the
secondary
and

structures
of
proteins

Proteins
with
little
or
no
secondary

Within
these
broad
categories
protein
structures
show
a
variety
of
folding
patterns
Among
proteins
with
similar
folding
patterns
there
are
families
that
share
enough
features
of
structure
sequence
and
function
to
suggest
an
evolutionary
relationship
However
unrelated
proteins
often
show
similar
structural
themes
Classification
of
protein
structures
occupies
a
key
position
in
bioinformatics
not
least
as
a
bridge
between
sequence
and
function
We
shall

this
theme

many
cases
on
the
research

of

Indeed
the
EBI
group
has
been
active
in
creating
a
series
of
very
useful

of

Protein
structure
prediction
and
engineering
The
amino
acid
sequence
of
a
protein
dictates
its
threedimensional
structure
In
a
medium
of
suitable
solvent
and
under
temperature
conditions
such
as
provided
by
a
cell
interior
proteins
fold
spontaneously
into
their
active
states
Chaperones
help
proteins
to
fold
properly
but
they
catalyse
the
process
rather
than
direct
it
If
amino
acid
sequences
contain
sufficient
information
to
specify
threedimensional
structures
of
proteins
it
should
be
possible
to
devise
an
algorithm
to
predict
protein
structure
from
amino
acid
sequence
This
has
proved
elusive
although
recent
progress
has
been
impressive
In
consequence
in
addition
to
pursuing
the
fundamental
problem
of
a
priori
prediction
of
protein
structure
from
amino
acid
sequence
scientists
have
defined
lessambitious
goals
as
follows
1
Secondary
structure
prediction
which
segments
of
the
sequence
form
helices
and
which
form
strands

2
Fold
recognition
given
a
library
of
known
protein
structures
and
their
amino
acid
sequences
and
the
amino
acid
sequence
of
a
protein
of
unknown
structure
can
we
find
the
structure
in
the
library
that
is
most
likely
to
have
a
folding
pattern
similar
to
that
of
the
protein
of
unknown
structure
3
Homology
modelling
suppose
a
target
protein
of
known
amino
acid
sequence
but
unknown
structure
is
homologous
to
one
or
more
proteins
of
known
structure
Then
we
expect
that
much
of
the
structure
of
the
target
protein
will
resemble
that
of
the
known
protein
and
it
can
serve
as
a
basis
for
a
model
of
the
target
structure
The
completeness
and
quality
of
the
result
depend
crucially
on
how
similar
the
sequences
are
As
a
rule
of
thumb
if
the
sequences
of
two
related
proteins
have
50
or
more
identical
residues
in
an
optimal
alignment
the
structures
are
likely
to
have
similar
conformations
over
more
than
90
of
the
model
This
is
a
conservative
estimate
as
the
following
illustration
shows
Here
are
the
aligned
sequences
and
superposed
structures
of
two
related
proteins
hen

lysozyme
black

baboon
lactalbumin
green
The
sequences
are
closely
related
37
identical
residues
in
the
aligned
sequences
and
the
structures
are
very
similar
Each
protein
could
serve
as
a
good
model
for
the
other
at
least
as
far
as
the
course
of
the
mainchain
is
concerned

Many
rules
about
protein
structure
were
derived
from
observations
of
natural
proteins
These
rules
do
not
necessarily
apply
to
engineered
proteins
Natural
proteins
have
features
required
by
general
principles
of
physical
chemistry
and
by
the
mechanism
of
protein
evolution
Engineered
proteins
must
obey
the
laws
of
physical
chemistry
but
not
the
constraints
of
evolution
Engineered
proteins
can
explore
new
territory
This
includes
enhancing
thermostability
and
catalytic
effectiveness
features
useful
for
industrial
processes
Methods
of
approach
include
directed

to
modify
a

and
de

design
and

of

Fields
of

the

biofuel

and

the

A
particular

is
to
create

DNA
microarrays
or
DNA
chips
are
devices
for
checking
a
sample
simultaneously
for
the
presence
of
many
sequences
DNA
microarrays
can
be
used
1
to
determine
expression
patterns
of
different
proteins
by
detection
of
mRNAs
or
2
for
genotyping
by
detection
of
different
variant
gene
sequences
including
but
not
limited
to
singlenucleotide
polymorphisms
SNPs
It
is
possible
to
measure
simple
presence
or
absence
or
to
quantitate
relative
abundance
A
caveat
is
that
because
of
differential
mRNA
lifetimes
and
translation
rates
the
concentrations
of
mRNAs
and
the
corresponding
proteins
are
not
necessarily
proportional

From
the
point
of
view
of
bioinformatics
DNA
arrays
are
yet
another
prolific
stream
of
data
creation
They
demand
effective
design
of
archives
and
information
retrieval
systems
One
advantage
is
that
the
data
are
all
so
new
that
the
field
is
not
encumbered
with
data
structures
and
formats
based
on
older
generations
of
hardware
and

Applications
of
DNA
microarrays
Identifying
genetic
individuality
in
tissues
or
organisms
or
genotyping
Detection
of
SNPs
is
one
example
In
humans
and
animals
this
permits
correlation
of
genotype
with
susceptibility
to
disease
In
bacteria
it
permits
identifying
mechanisms
of
development
of
drug
resistance
by
pathogens
Investigating
cellular
states
and
processes
Patterns
of
expression
that
change
with
cellular
state
or
growth
conditions
can
give
clues
to
the
mechanisms
of
processes
such
as
sporulation
or
the
change
from
aerobic
to
anaerobic
metabolism
Diagnosis
of
genetic
disease
Testing
for
the
presence
of
mutations
can
confirm
the
diagnosis
of
a
suspected
genetic
disease
Detection
of
carriers
can
help
in
counselling
prospective
parents
Diagnosis
of
infectious
disease
Microarrays
can
detect
viruses
or
other
pathogens
in
blood
samples
It
may
be
possible
to
recognize
strains
resistant
to
certain
antibiotics
guiding
optimal
treatment
and
isolation
protocols
Specialized
diagnosis
of
disease
Different
types
of
leukaemia
for
example
can
be
identified
by
different
patterns
of
gene
expression
Knowing
the
exact
type
of
the
disease
is
important
for
prognosis
and
for
selecting
treatment
More

expression
profiling
of
tumours
permits
analysis
of
development
and
progression
of
the

Genetic
warning
signs
Some
diseases
are
not
determined
entirely
and
irrevocably
by
genotype
but
the
probability
of
their
development
is
correlated
with
genes
or
their
expression
patterns
A
person
aware
of
an
enhanced
risk
of
developing
a
condition
can
in
some
cases
improve
his
or
her
prospects
by
adjustments
in
lifestyle
or
in
some
cases
even
prophylactic
surgery
Drug
selection
Genetic
factors
can
be
detected
that
govern
responses
to
drugs
that
in
some
patients
render
treatment
ineffective
and
in
others
cause
unusual
serious
adverse
reactions
Target
selection
for
drug
design
Proteins
showing
enhanced
transcription
in
particular
disease
states
might
be
candidates
for
attempts
at
pharmacological
intervention
Detection
of
genes
expressed
in
pathogens
are
useful
for
identification
of
the
pathogen
and
for
choosing
targets
for
drug
design
Pathogen
resistance
Comparisons
of
genotypes
or
expression
patterns
between
bacterial
strains
susceptible
and
resistant
to
an
antibiotic
point
to
the
proteins
involved
in
the
mechanism
of
resistance
Measuring
temporal
variations
in
protein
expression
This
permits
timing
the
course
of
many
interesting
processes
including
1
responses
to
pathogen
infection
2
responses
to
environmental
change
and
3
changes
during
the
cell
cycle
75Transcriptomics
and
RNA
sequencing
The
direct
sequencing
of
RNA
is
replacing
microarrays
as
the
method
of
choice
for
detecting
patterns
of
transcription
Reverse
transcription
into
complementary
DNA
cDNA
of
RNA
extracted
from
a
sample
of
cells
allows
the
application
of
highthroughput
DNA
sequencing
techniques
Both
static
versus
dynamic
and
isolated
versus
distributed
information
is
available
from
the
sequences
of
particular
cells
at
a
particular
time
it
is
possible
to
detect
for
example
abundances
splice
variants
SNPs
and
RNA
editing
It
is
also
possible
to
compare
different
tissues
samples
of
healthy
versus
diseased
tissues
and

on
cell
and
organism
age
Mass
spectrometry
Mass
spectrometry
is
a
physical
technique
that
characterizes
molecules
by
measuring
the
masses
of
their
ions
Applications
to
proteomics
include
rapid
identification
of
the
components
of
a
complex
mixture
of
proteins
partial
sequencing
of
proteins
and
nucleic
acids
analysis
of
posttranslational
modifications
or
substitutions
relative
to
an
expected
sequence
measuring
extents
of
hydrogendeuterium
exchange
to
reveal
the
solvent
exposure
of
individual
sites
This
provides
information
about
static
conformation
dynamicsincluding
folding
and
aggregationand
interactions
Systems
biology
The
watchword
of
systems
biology
is
integration
Integration
has
two
aspects
One
is
the
study
of
patterns
within
a
cell
or
an
organism
patterns
of
proteinprotein
and
proteinnucleic
acid
interactions
patterns
of
metabolic
pathways
and
control
cascades
and
patterns
of
protein
expression
Patterns
have
both
static
and
dynamic
aspects
Identification
of
pairs
of
proteins
that
bind
to
each
other
and
the
assembly
of
pairwise
interactions
into
a
network
produces
a
static
pattern
The
flow
of
metabolites
through
a
network
of
enzymes
or
the
flow
of
information
down
a
control
cascade
is
a
dynamic
pattern
The
other
aspect
of
integration
is
the
comparison
of
occurrence
activities
and
interactions
of
genes
and
proteins
across
different
species
The
reason
why
the
comparative
approach
is
so
powerful
in
biology
is
that
the
systems
we
are
trying
to
understand
arose
through
processes
of
evolution
Different
species
illuminate
one
another
To
understand
what
it
means
to
be
human
we
must
appreciate
both
what
we
have
in
common
with
other
species
and
how
we
differ
Highthroughput
methods
of
genomics
and
proteomics
provide
data
about
sequences
expression
patterns
and
interactions
From
genome
sequences
we
can
infer
the
amino
acid
sequences
of
an
organisms
complement
of
proteins
Proteomics
tells
us
how
expression
patterns
of
these
proteins
vary
within
the
organism
how
they
change
during
development
or
in
response
to
changes
in
conditions
and
how
they
cooperate
with
one
another
Systems
biology
takes
these
data
as
pieces
of
a
jigsaw
puzzle
that
extends
in
both
space
and
time
To
understand
the
complex
and
delicate
instrument
that
is
the
living
cell
we
must
fit
the
pieces
into
their
frame
Clinical
implications
76There
is
consensus
that
the
sequencing
of
human
and
other
genomes
will
lead
to
improvements
in
human
health
Even
discounting
some
of
the
more
outrageous
claimshype
springs
eternal
categories
of
applications
include
the
following

Diagnosis

DNA
sequencing
can
detect
the
absence
of
a
particular

or
a

Identification

will
permit
fast
and

In
many
cases
our
genes
do
not
irrevocably
condemn
us
to
contract
a
disease
but
raise
the
probability
that
we
will
An
example
of
a
risk
factor
detectable
at
the
genetic
level
involves
1
antitrypsin
a
protein
that
normally
functions
to
inhibit

in
the
alveoli
of
the
lung
People

for
the
Z
mutant
of
1
antitrypsin

They
are
at

of
emphysema
because
of
damage
to
the
lungs
from
endogenous
elastase
unchecked
by
normal
inhibitory
activity
and
also
of
liver
disease
because
of
accumulation
of
a
polymeric
form
of
the

1
antitrypsin

Huntingtons
disease
Huntingtons
disease
is
an
inherited
neurodegenerative
disorder
affecting
510
people
in
every
100
000
worldwide
Its
symptoms
are
quite
severe
including
uncontrollable
dancelike
choreatic
movements
mental
disturbance
personality
changes
and
intellectual
impairment
Death
usually
follows
within
1015
years
after
the
onset
of
symptoms
The
gene
arrived
in
New
England
during
the
colonial
period
in
the
17th
century
It
may
have
been
responsible
for
some
accusations
of
witchcraft
The
gene
has
not
been
eliminated
from
the
population
because
the
age
of
onset3050
yearsis
after
the
typical
reproductive
period
Formerly
members
of
affected
families
had
no
alternative
but
to
face
the
uncertainty
and
fear
during
youth
and
early
adulthood
of
not
knowing
whether
they
had
inherited
the
disease
The
discovery
of
the
gene
for
Huntingtons
disease
in
1993
made
it
possible
to
identify
affected
individuals
The
gene
contains
expanded
repeats
of
the
trinucleotide
CAG
corresponding
to
polyglutamine
blocks
in
the
corresponding
protein
huntingtin
Huntingtons
disease
is
one
of
a
family
of
neurodegenerative
conditions
resulting
from
trinucleotide
repeats
The
larger
the
block
of
CAGs
the
earlier
the
onset
and
more
severe
the
symptoms
The
normal
gene
contains
1128
CAG
repeats
People
with
2934
repeats
are
unlikely
to
develop
the
disease
and
those
with
35
41
repeats
may
develop
only
relatively
mild
symptoms
However
people
with
more
than
41
repeats
are
almost
certain
to
suffer
full
Huntingtons
disease
The
inheritance
is
marked
by
a
phenomenon
called
anticipation
the
repeats
grow
longer
in
successive
generations
progressively
increasing
the
severity
of
the
disease
and
reducing
the
age
of
onset
For
some
reason
this
effect
is
greater
in
paternal
than
in
maternal
genes
Therefore
even
people
in
the
borderline
region
who
might
bear
a
gene
containing
2941
repeats
should
be
counselled
about
the
risks
to
their
offspring

Two
clinical
applications
of
human
genome
sequencing
Two
examples
involve
subjects
who
have
voluntarily
disclosed
information
about
their
own
medical
histories
77James
D
Watson
discoverer
of
the
double
helix
with
Francis
Crick
in
1953
was
later
in
his
life
treated
for
high
blood
pressure
with
a
type
of
drug
called
a
blocker
Blockers
target
the
adregenic
receptor
active
in
stress
response
Watson
found
that
the
drug
was
making
him
inappropriately
sleepy
His
genome
sequence
revealed
that
he
was
homozygous
for
a
variant
of
a
gene
for
cytochrome
P450
resulting
in
unusually
slow
metabolism
of

from

J

Often
the
relationship
between
genotype
and
disease
risk
is
much
more
difficult
to
pin
down
Some
diseases
such
as
asthma
depend
on
interactions
of
many
genes
as
well
as
environmental
factors
In
other
cases
a
gene
may
be
all
present
and
correct
but
a
mutation
elsewhere
may
alter
its
level
of
expression
or
distribution
among
tissues
Such
abnormalities
must
be
detected
by
measurements
of
protein
activity
Analysis
of
protein
expression
patterns
is
also
an
important
way
to
measure
response
to

Genomewide
association
studies
GWAS
are
a
common
approach
to
determining
sites
responsible
for
diseases
Comparing
of
genome
sequences
of
patients
with
a
control
group
permits
statistical
analysis
of
the
correlation
of
the
disease
with
sequence
changes
The
changes
usually
take
the
form
of
SNPs
It
might
be
thought
that
such
studies
are
simplified
by
limiting
them
to
exon
sequences
However
the
ENCODE
project
has
shown
that
more

lie

Genetics
of

Because
people
differ
in
their
ability
to
metabolize
drugs
different

may
require
different

see
Box
113
Sequence
analysis
permits

drugs
and

for
individual

a

Physicians
can

procedure
that

Treatment
of

consumes
billions
of

costs
See
Weblem

For
example
the
very
toxic
drug
6mercaptopurine
is
used
in
the
treatment
of
childhood
leukaemia
A
small
fraction
of
patients
used
to
die
from
the
treatment
because
they
lacked
the
enzyme
thiopurine
methyltransferase
needed
to
metabolize
the
drug
Testing
of
patients
for
this
enzyme
identifies
those
at
risk
Conversely
it
may
become
possible
to
use
drugs
that
are
safe
and
effective
in
a
minority
of
patients
but
which
have
been
rejected
before
or
during
clinical
trials

Identification
of
drug
targets
Many
drugs
will
affect
the
symptoms
or
underlying
causes
of
a
disease
by
interaction
with
a
specific
protein
to
alter
its
function
This
protein
is
the
target
of
the
drugdiscovery
process
The
specificity
of
the
interaction
is
important
interaction
of
the
drug
with
other
proteins
may
lead
to
unacceptable
side
effects
Identification
of
a
target
provides
the
78focus
for
subsequent
steps
in
the
drugdesign
process
Among
drugs
now
in
use
the
targets
of
about
half
are
receptors
about
a
quarter
are
enzymes
and
about
another
quarter
are
hormones
Approximately
7
act
on
unknown
targets
The
growth
in
bacterial
resistance
to
antibiotics
is
creating
a
crisis
in
disease
control
There
is
a
very
real
possibility
that
our
descendants
will
look
back
at
the
second
half
of
the
twentieth
century
as
a
narrow
window
during
which
bacterial
infections
could
be
controlled
and
before
and
after
which
they
could
not
The
urgency
of
finding
new
drugs
is
mitigated
by
the
increasing
availability
of
data
on
which
to
base
their
development
Genomics
can
suggest
targets
Differential
genomics
and
comparison
of
protein
expression
patterns
between
drugsensitive
and
resistant
strains
of
pathogenic
bacteria
can
pinpoint
the
proteins
responsible
for
drug
resistance
The
study
of
genetic
variation
between
tumour
and
normal
cells
can
identify
differentially
expressed
proteins
as
potential
targets
for
anticancer
drugs

Gene
therapy
If
a

or
defective

it
or

If
a

to

Direct

of
proteins
is
possible
for
many
diseases
of
which
insulin

diabetes

Factor

a
common
form
of
haemophilia
are
perhaps
the

Gene
transfer

In
human

there
have
been
clinical
successes
in
treating
immunodeficiency
Lebers
congenital
amaurosis
adrenoleukodystrophy
chronic
myelogenous
leukemia
and
Parkinsons
disease
One
approach
to
blocking
genes
is
called
antisense
therapy
The
idea
is
to
introduce
a
short
stretch
of
DNA
or
RNA
that
binds
in
a
sequencespecific
manner
to
a
region
of
a
gene
Binding
to
endogenous
DNA
can
interfere
with
transcription
binding
to
mRNA
can
interfere
with
translation
Antisense
therapy
has
shown
some
efficacy
against
cytomegalovirus
and
Crohn
disease
Antisense
therapy
is
very
attractive
because

It
is
extremely
likely
that
Szent

Cancer

One
hopes
that
this
will
happen
because
the

against

than

The
genome
of
a

comes
as
a

molecule
of
about
5
million
characters
about
the

as
a

The

Different
patterns
of

also
characterize
different

and
different

within
an

Some

such

mRNA
involved

are
transient
Some
such

the

These
include
microRNAs

small

and

piRNAs
which

It
is
clear
that
cellular
RNA
is
a
far
more
complex
domain
than
was
for
a
long
time
adequately
appreciated
The
relationship
between
DNA

and

is
not
direct
As
a
very
rough
rule
of
thumb
all
metazoa
have
slightly
over
20
000
proteincoding
genes
But
not
all
DNA
codes
for

Conversely
some
genes
exist
in
multiple
copies
In
eukarya
many
genes
produce
several
different
proteins
by
alternative

Therefore
the

of

in

Genes
A
single
gene
coding
for
a
particular
protein
corresponds
to
a
sequence
of
nucleotides
along
one
or
more
regions
of
a
molecule
of
DNA
In
cells
genes
may
appear
on
either
strand
of
DNA
Bacterial
genes
are
continuous
regions
of
DNA
The
nucleotide
sequence
of
the
DNA
and
the
amino
acid
sequence
of
the
corresponding
protein
are
collinear
Therefore
the
functional
unit
of
genetic
sequence
information
from
a
bacterium
is
a
string
of
3
N
nucleotides
encoding
a
string
of
N
amino
acids
or
a
string
of
N
nucleotides
encoding
a
structural
RNA
molecule
of
N
nucleotides
together
with
associated
control

Such
a
string
equipped
with

The
conclusion
is
that
to
reduce

to
individual
coding
sequences
is
to
disguise
the
very
complex
nature
of
the
interrelationships
among
them
and
to
ignore
the
historical
and
integrative
aspects
of
the
genome
Robbins
has
expressed
the
situation
unimprovably
Consider
the
32
gigabytes
of
a
human
genome
as
equivalent
to
32
gigabytes
of
files
on
the
massstorage
device
of
some
computer
system
of
unknown
design
Obtaining
the
sequence
is
equivalent
to
obtaining
an
image
of
the
contents
of
that
massstorage
device
Understanding
the
sequence
is
equivalent
to
reverse
engineering
that
unknown
computer
system
both
the
hardware
and
the
32
gigabytes
of
software
all
the
way
back
to
a
full
set
of
design
and
maintenance
specifications
Reverse
engineering
the
sequence
is
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
resulting
image
of
the
mass
storage
device
will
not
be
a
filebyfile
copy
but
rather
a
streaming
dump
of
the
bytes
in
the
order
they
were
entered
into
the
device
Furthermore
the
files
are
known
to
be
fragmented
In
addition
some
of
the
device
contains
erased
files
or
other
garbage
Once
the
garbage
has
been
recognized
and
discarded
and
the
fragmented
files
reassembled
the
reverse
engineering
of
the
codes
can
be
undertaken
with
only
a
partial
and
sometimes
incorrect
understanding
of
the
CPU
on
which
the
codes
run
In
fact
deducing
the
structure
and
function
of
the
CPU
is
part
of
the
project
since
some
of
the
32
gigabytes
are
the
binary
specifications
for
the
computerassistedmanufacturing
process
that
fabricates
the
CPU
In
addition
one
must
also
consider
that
the
huge
database
also
contains
code
generated
from
the
result
of
literally
millions
of
maintenance

What
reveals
the
activity
of
a
cell
at
any

at
the
molecular
level
is
the
set
of
RNAs
being
transcribed
and
the
set
of

synthesized
These
also
show
the
state
of

of
different

and
can
in
some
cases
mark
the

of

The
DNA
does
contain
some
clues
notably
in
epigenetic

However
inventories
of
RNA
molecules
and
proteins
in
cells
deal
in
a
more
direct
and
integral
way
with
cellular
status
and
activity
These
data
are
the
subjects

projects
What
kinds
of
data
would
we
like
to
measure
and
what
mature
experimental
techniques
exist
to
determine
them
The
basic
goal
is
a
spatiotemporal
description
of
the
inventory
and
deployment
of
RNAs
and
proteins
in
the
organism
These
vary
among

88Proteomics
Measurement
of
proteincoding
RNA
transcripts
provides
more
information
about
the
cells
proteins
than
genome
sequences
do
However
because
proteins
are
both
synthesized
and
turned
over
at
different
rates
it
is
also
necessary
to
measure
proteins
directly
Highresolution

the
pattern
of
protein
content
in

Massspectrometric
techniques

the
proteins
into
which
the
sample
has
been
separated
We
shall
develop
these
topics
in
Chapter
9
Application
of
these
methods
provides
a
picture
of
the
proteinbased
activity
of
an
organism
as
the
genome
provides
a
complete
set
of
potential
proteins
R
Simpson
has
drawn
an
analogy
if
the
genome
is
a
list
of
the
instruments
in
an
orchestra
the
proteome
is
the
orchestra
in
the
process
of
playing
a
symphony
Historically
the
chemical
problem
of
determining
amino
acid
sequences
of
proteins
directly
was
solved
before
the
genetic
code
was
established
and
before
methods
for
determination
of
nucleotide
sequences
of
DNA
were
developed
F
Sangers
sequencing
of
insulin
in
1955
first
proved
that
proteins
had
definite
amino
acid
sequences
a
proposition
that
until
then
was
hypothetical
However
muchalthough
not
allinformation
about
the
amino
acid
sequences
of
an
organisms
proteins
are
inherent
in
its
genome
sequence
by
virtue
of
the
genetic
code
Indeed
new
protein
sequence
data
are
now
being
determined
by
translation
of
DNA
sequences
rather
than
by
direct
sequencing
of
proteins
See
Weblem
27
Yet
it
is
important
to
distinguish
amino
acid
sequences
inferred
by
translation
from
DNA
and
actual
sequences
of
proteins
First
we
must
assume
that
it
is
possible
correctly
to
identify
within
DNA
sequences
the
regions
that
encode
proteins
The
patternrecognition
programs
that
address
this
question
are
subject
to
three
types
of
error
a
genuine
protein
sequence
may
be
missed
entirely
an
incomplete
protein
may
be
reported
or
a
gene
may
be
incorrectly
spliced
Several
variations
on
the
theme
add
to
the
complexity
genes
for
different
proteins
may
overlap
or
genes
may
be
assembled
from
exons
in
different
ways
in
different
tissues
or
even
in
individual
cells
In
rare
cases
the
genetic
code
of
a
species
may
contain
slightly
different
codonamino
acid
mappings
than
the
standard
In
some
cases
mRNA
is
edited
before
translation
altering
amino
acid
sequences
in
ways
not
inferrable
from
the
gene
sequences
Conversely
some
genetic
sequences
that
appear
to
code
for
proteins
may
in
fact
be
defective
or
not
expressed
A
protein
inferred
from
a
genome
sequence
is
a
hypothetical
object
until
an
experiment
verifies
its
existence
Several
other
important
features
of
proteins
are
not
available
from
genome
sequences
even
if
proteincoding
regions
are
identified
accurately
Genome
sequences
give
no
clue
to
the
quaternary
structure
of
a
protein
for
instance
how
could
one
deduce
from
the
genome
sequence
that
adult
haemoglobin
is
a
tetramer
containing
two
and
two
chains
Many
proteins
bind
prosthetic
groups
these
are
invisible
in
the
genome
Patterns
of
disulphide
bridgesprimary
chemical
bonds
between
cysteine
residuescannot
be
deduced
directly
from
the
amino
acid
sequence
In
addition
to
binding
ligands
integral
to
the
native
structure
many
proteins
undergo
covalent
alterations
within
a
cell
to
make
a
mature
protein
that
differs
significantly
from
the
one
suggested
by
translation
of
the
gene
sequence
In
many
cases
the
missing
details
of
posttranslational
modifications
the
molecular
analogues
of
body
piercingare
quite
important
Posttranslational
modifications
include
addition
of
ligands
for
instance
the
covalently
bound
haem
group
of
cytochrome
c
glycosylation
methylation
phosphorylation
excision
of
peptides
and
many
others
Cleavage
of
a
peptide
is
a
common
posttranslational
modification
In
some
cases
cleavage
89converts
an
inactive
form
of
a
protein
to
an
active
one
The
proteases
active
in
digestion
of
our
food
are
examples
In
other
cases
the
effect
is
to
promote
correct
folding
For
instance
insulin
is
synthesized
as
a
singlechain
precursor
that
folds
properly
after
which
excision
of
a
peptide
produces
the
mature
oligomeric
form
Most
posttranslational
cleavage
reactions
are
carried
out
by
proteases
Alternatively
inteins
are
proteins
that
have
a
selfsplicing
activity
They
autocatalytically
excise
internal
peptides
and
join
the
ends
In
contrast
peptide
excision
from
proinsulin
leaves
two
chains
that
are
not
joined
by
a
peptide
bond
Transcriptomics
Between
the
genome
and
the
proteome
lies
the
transcriptome
This
rather
glib
statement
is
not
so
much
untrue
but
incomplete
In
some
ways
analogous
to
proteomics
transcriptomics
deals
with
the
inventory
of
RNA
molecules
in
the
cell
Some
of
the
RNA
is
transient
such
as
mRNA
Much
is
stable
such
as
the
RNA
components
of
the
ribosome
which
typically
accounts
for
over
90
of
cellular
RNA
Some
RNA
molecules
exert
control
over
translation
We
now
recognize
that
the
RNA
world
is
much
more
complex
than
previously
suspected
Indeed
we
now
know
that
6070
of
the
human
genome
is
not
transcriptionally
inert
although
we
dont
know
the
function
of
many
of
the
RNAs
produced
The
implication
is
that
the
transcriptome
and
proteome
are
not
as
closely
related
as
once
thought
Many
RNA
transcripts
are
not
proteincoding
The
RNAseq
method
applies
modern
sequencing
techniques
to
inventory
RNA
molecules
RNA
fragments
are
converted
to
cDNA
and
highthroughput
sequencing
methods
applied
Because
variation
in
the
yields
of
the
RNA
cDNA
step
may
bias
the
results
there
is
current
effort
to
develop
methods
to
sequence
RNA
directly
RNA
sequencing
methods
are
competitive
with
if
they
have
not
entirely
superseded
classical
microarray
methods
An
advantage
of
RNA
sequencing
is
that
one
need
not
know
in
advance
the
information
required
to
create
microarray
chips
Eavesdropping
on
the
transmission
of
genetic
information
How
hereditary
information
is
stored
passed
on
and
implemented
is
perhaps
the
fundamental
problem
of
biology
Three
types
of
maps
have
been
essential

2
banding

3
DNA

These
maps
represent
three
very
different

of

Genes
as
discovered
by
Mendel
were
entirely
abstract
entities
Chromosomes
are
physical

banding

visible

Only
with
DNA
sequences
are
we
dealing
directly
with

hereditary
information
in

physical

It
was
the
very
great
achievement
of
biology
during
the
last
century
to
forge
connections
between
these
three
types
of
data
The
first
stepswhich
were

the

A

endonuclease
is
an

that
cuts
DNA
at
a
specific
sequence
usually
about
6
bp
long
Cutting
DNA
with
several
restriction

with

produces
sets

From

it

possible
to

stating
the

A
mutation
in
one
of
these
cleavage
sites
will
change
the
sizes
of
the
fragments
produced
by
the
corresponding
enzyme
allowing
the

to
be
located
in

Restriction
enzymes
can
produce
fairly
large
pieces
of

Cutting
the
DNA
into
smaller

which
are

ordered

produces

Identification
of
genes
associated
with
inherited
diseases
In
the
past
the
connections
between
chromosomes
genes
and
DNA
sequences
were
essential
for
identifying
the
molecular
deficits
underlying
inherited
diseases
such
as
Huntingtons
disease
or
cystic
fibrosis
Sequencing
of
the
human
genome
has
changed
the
situation
radically
Given
a
disease
attributable
to
a
defective
protein
if
we
know
the
protein
involved
we
can
pursue
rational
approaches
to
therapy
if
we
know
the

involved
we
can
devise

A

is
classically

by
observed
patterns
of
heredity
Linkage

frequencies
can

whether
genes
are
on
the

or
different
chromosomes
and
for
genes
on
the

how
far
apart
they

The
principle
is
that
the
farther
apart
two
linked
genes
are
the
more
likely
they
are
to
recombine
by
crossing
over
during
meiosis
Indeed
two
genes
on
the

very
far

will
appear
to

chromosomes
are
numbered

The

Subsequent
digits
indicate

q
arm
of
human
chromosome

are
labelled

Originally
bands
15q11

were
defined
subsequently
15q11

For

associated
with
PraderWilli
and
Angleman

These
syndromes
have
the
interesting
feature
that
the
alternative
clinical
consequences
depend
on
whether
the
affected
chromosome
is
paternal
or
maternal
This
observation
of

shows
that

is

is

it
is
required
only
for

the

providing
a
bridge
between
the
patterns
of
inheritance
and
the
DNA
sequence
This
is
not
true
of
diseases
arising
from
chromosome
abnormalities
For
instance
in
the
case
of
sicklecell
anaemia
we
know
the
protein
involved
The
disease
arises
from
a
single

mutation
in

We
can
proceed
directly
to

We

In

we

Patterns

a
condition
Simple
Mendelian
inheritance
patterns
show
for
example
that
Huntingtons
disease
and
cystic
fibrosis
are
92caused
by
single
genes
To
find
the
gene
associated
with
cystic
fibrosis
it
was
necessary
to
begin
with
the
gene
map
using
linkage
patterns
of
heredity
in
affected
families
to
localize
the
affected
gene
to
a
particular
region
of
a
particular
chromosome
Knowing
the
general
region
of
the
chromosome
it
was
then
possible
to
search
the
DNA
of
that
region
to
identify
candidate
genes
and
finally
to
pinpoint
the
particular
gene
responsible
and
sequence
it

In

many
diseases
do
not
show
simple
inheritance
or
even
if
only
a
single

is
involved
heredity
creates
only
a

Identification
of
the
cystic

Cystic
fibrosis
a
disease
known
to
folklore
since
at
least
the
Middle
Ages
and
to
science
for
about
500
years
is
an
inherited
recessive
autosomal
condition
Its
symptoms
include
intestinal
obstruction
reduced
fertility
including
anatomical
abnormalities
especially
in
males
and
recurrent
clogging
and
infection
of
lungs
which
is
the
primary
cause
of
death
now
that
there
are
effective
treatments
for
the
gastrointestinal
symptoms
Approximately
half
the
sufferers
die
before
the
age
of
25
years
and
few
survive
beyond
50
Cystic
fibrosis
affects
1
in
2500
individuals
in
the
American
and
European
populations
Approximately
1
in
25
white
people
carry
a
mutant
gene
as
do
1
in
65
AfricanAmericans
The
protein
that
is
defective
in
cystic
fibrosis
also
acts
as
a
receptor
for
uptake
of
Salmonella
typhi
the
pathogen
that
causes
typhoid
fever
Increased
resistance
to
typhoid
in
heterozygoteswho
do
not
develop
cystic
fibrosis
itself
but
are
carriers
of
the
mutant
geneprobably
explains
why
the
gene
has
not
been
eliminated
from
the
population
The
pattern
of
inheritance
showed
that
cystic
fibrosis
was
the
effect
of
a
single
gene
However
the
actual
protein
involved
was
unknown
It
had
to
be
found
via
the
gene
Note
that
this
work
was
carried
out
before
the
human
genome
sequence
was
available
Clinical
observations
provided
the
gene
hunters
with
useful
clues
It
was
known
that
the
problem
had
to
do
with
chloride
transport
in
epithelial
tissues
Folklore
had
long
recognized
that
children
with
excessive
salt
in
their
sweattasteable
when
kissing
an
infant
on
the
foreheadwere
shortlived
Modern
physiological
studies
showed
that
epithelial
tissues
of
cystic
fibrosis
patients
cannot
reabsorb
chloride
When
closing
in
on
the
gene
the
expected
distributionamong
tissuesof
its
expression
and
of
the
type
of
protein
implicated
were
useful
guides

the
gene
for
cystic
fibrosis
was
isolated
and
sequenced

The
gene
comprising
24
exons
spans
a

region
For
70
of
mutant
alleles
the
mutation
is
a
3
bp
deletion
deleting
the
residue
508
Phe
from
the
protein
This
mutation
is
denoted
del508
The
effect
of
the
deletion
is
defective
translocation
of
the
protein
which
is
degraded
in
the
endoplasmic
reticulum
rather
than
being
transported
to
the

membrane
An

give

from

and

have
taken

of
the

are

The

it
to

The

A

was
cloned
Probes

Identification
of
genes

up

There
have
been
several

to

but
specialized
new
techniques
can
achieve
high

down
to

Simultaneous
FISH
with
two
probes
can
detect
linkage
and
even
estimate
genetic
distances
This
is
important
in
species
for
which
the
generation
time
is
long
enough
to
make
standard
genetic
approaches
inconvenient
FISH
can
also
detect
chromosomal
abnormalities
Somatic
cell
hybrids
are
rodent
cells
containing
few
one
or
even
partial
human
chromosomes
Chromosome
fragments
are
produced
by
irradiating
the
human
cells
prior
to

Such

are
called
radiation
hybrids
Hybridization
of
a
probe
sequence
with
a
panel
of
somatic
cell
hybrids
detected
by
fluorescence
can
identify
which
chromosome
contains
the
probe
This

has

superseded
by
use

VNTRs
are
characteristics
of
genome
sequences
RFLPs
are
artificial
mixtures
of
short
stretches
of
DNA
created
in
the
laboratory
in
order
to
identify
VNTRs
However
it
is
much
easier
and
more
efficient
to
measure
the
sizes
of
VNTRs
by
amplifying
them
with
PCR
and
this
method
has
replaced
the
use
of
restriction
enzymes
Short
tandemrepeat
polymorphisms
STRPs
also
called
microsatellites
STRPs
are
regions
of
only
25
bp
but
repeated
many
times
typically
1030
consecutive
copies
They
have
several
advantages
as
markers
over
VNTRs
one
of
which
is
a
more
even
distribution
over
the
human
genome
There
is
no
reason
why
these
markers
need
lie
within
expressed
genes
and
usually
they
do
not
The
CAG
repeats
in
the
gene
for
Huntington
and
certain
other
disease
genes
are
exceptions
Panels
of
microsatellite
markers
greatly
simplify
the
identification
of
genes
It
is
interesting
to
compare
a
recent
project
to
identify
a
disease
gene
now
that
the
human
genome
sequence
is
available
with
such
classic
studies
as
the
identification
of
the
gene
for
cystic
fibrosis
Additional
mapping
techniques
deal
more
directly
with
the
DNA
sequences
and
can
shortcircuit
the
process
of
gene
identification
A
contig
or
contiguous
clone
map
is
a
series
of
overlapping
DNA
clones
of
known
order
along
a
95chromosome
from
an
organism
of
interestfor
instance
humanstored
in
yeast
or
bacterial
cells
as
YACs
or
BACs
A
contig
map
can
produce
very
fine
mapping
of
a
genome
In
a
YAC
human
DNA
is
stably
integrated
into
a
small
extra
chromosome
in
a
yeast
cell
A
YAC
can
contain
up
to
10
6
bp
In
principle
the
entire
human
genome
could
be
represented
in
10
000
YAC
clones
In
a
BAC
human
DNA
is
inserted
into
a
plasmid
in
an
E
coli
cell
A
plasmid
is
a
small
piece
of
doublestranded
DNA
found
in
addition
to
the
main
genome
usually
but
not
always
circular
A
BAC
can
carry
about
250
000
bp
Despite
their
smaller
capacities
BACs
are
preferred
to
YACs
because
of
their
greater
stability
and
ease
of
handling
A
sequence
tagged
site
STS
is
a
short
sequenced
region
of
DNA
typically
200600
bp
long
that
appears
in
a
unique
location
in
the
genome
It
need
not
be
polymorphic
An
STS
can
be
mapped
into
the
genome
by
using
PCR
to
test
for
the
presence
of
the
sequence
in
the
cells
containing
a
contig
map
One
type
of
STS
arises
from
an
expressed
sequence
tag
EST
a
piece
of
cDNA
complementary
DNA
that
is
a
DNA
sequence
derived
from
the
mRNA
of
an
expressed
gene
The
sequence
contains
only
the
exons
of
the
gene
spliced
together
to
form
the
sequence
that
encodes
the
protein
cDNA
sequences
can
be
mapped
to
chromosomes
using
FISH
or
located
within
contig
maps
How
do
contig
maps
and
STSs
facilitate
identifying
genes
If
you
are
working
with
an
organism
for
which
the
full
genome
sequence
is
not
known
but
for
which
full
contig
maps
are
available
for
all
chromosomes
you
would
identify
STS
markers
that
are
tightly
linked
to
your
gene
and
then
locate
these
markers
in
the
contig
maps
Genomewide
association
studies
The
goal
of
genomewide
association
studies
is
the
correlation
between
phenotypic
traits
and
specific
locations
in
the
genome
Of
particular
interest
is
understanding
the
genetics
of
appearance
or
risk
of
diseases
see
Box
25
In
cases
of
simple
Mendelian
inheritance
one
specific
allele
may
govern
the
observed
trait
In
other
cases
multiple
sites
in
the
genome
may
influence
the
trait
In
addition
there
may
be
contributions
to
the
observed
phenotype
from
epigenetic
signals
and
from
the
environment
The
genetic
data
most
often
used
in
genomewide
association
studies
are
a
set
of
SNPs
To
isolate
the
genetic
concomitants
of
disease
studies
compare
cases
and
controls
people
with
a
disease
and
healthy
people
It
is
not
necessary
to
examine
every
possible
SNP
The
human
genome
consists
of
a
succession
of
haplotype
blockscoinherited
regions
with
relatively
little
recombination
within
them
Haplotype
blocks
vary
in
length
but
100150
kb
is
typical
A
correlation
between
disease
or
other
phenotype
with
any
representative
locus
within
some
haplotype
points
to
this
region
as
containing
some
gene
of
interest
More
finegrained
studies
of
the
regions
of
interest
can
pinpoint
a

Macular

Although

Genomewide

These

have

They
give
some
clue
about
the
underlying
biology
For
instance
the
prevalence
of
genes
coding
for
proteins
involved
in
the
immune

has
led
to
the
suggestion
that
development
of

is
related
to
inflammation

They
allow
for
evaluation
of
risk
In
particular
a
correlation
of
LOC387715
with
enhanced
risk
of
development
of
macular
degeneration
as
a
result
of
smoking
suggests
that

Picking
out
genes
in
genomes
Computer
programs
for
genome
analysis
identify
open
reading
frames
or
ORFs
An
ORF
is
a
region
of
DNA
sequence
that
begins
with
an
initiation
codon
ATG
and
ends
with
a
stop
codon
An
ORF
is
a
potential
proteincoding
region
Approaches
to
identifying
proteincoding
regions
choose
from
or
combine
two
possible
approaches
1
Detection
of
regions
similar
to
known
coding
regions
from
other
organisms
These
regions
may
encode
amino
acid
sequences
similar
to
known
proteins
or
may
be
similar
to
ESTs
Because
ESTs
are
derived
from
mRNA
they
correspond
to
genes
known
to
be
transcribed
It
is
necessary
to
sequence
only
a
few
hundred
initial
bases
of
cDNA
to
give
enough
information
to
identify
a
97gene
Characterization
of
genes
by
ESTs
is
like
indexing
poems
or
songs
by
their
first
lines
2
Ab
initio
methods
that
seek
to
identify
genes
from
the
properties
of
the
DNA
sequences
themselves
Computerassisted
annotation
of
genomes
is
more
complete
and
accurate
for
bacteria
than
for
eukarya
Bacterial
genes
are
relatively
easy
to
identify
because
they
are
contiguousthey
lack
the
introns
characteristic
of
eukaryotic
genomesand
the
intergene
spaces
are
small
In
higher
organisms
identifying
genes
is
harder
Identification
of
exons
is
one
problem
assembling
them
is
another
Alternative
splicing
patterns
present
a
particular
difficulty
A
framework
for
ab
initio
gene
identification
in
eukaryotic
genomes
includes
the
following
features
The
initial
5
exon
starts
with
a
transcription
start
point
preceded
by
a
core
promotor
site
such
as
the
TATA
box
typically
30
bp
upstream
It
is
free
of
inframe
stop
codons
and
ends
immediately
before
a
dinucleotide
GT
splice
signal
Occasionally
a
noncoding
exon
precedes
the
exon
that
contains
the
initiator
codon
Internal
exons
like
initial
exons
are
free
of
inframe
stop
codons
They
begin
immediately
after
an
AG
splice
signal
and
end
immediately
before
a
GT
splice
signal
The
final
3
exon
starts
immediately
after
an
AG
splice
signal
and
ends
with
a
stop
codon
followed
by
a
polyadenylation
signal
sequence
Occasionally
a
noncoding
exon
follows
the
exon
that
contains
the
stop
codon
All
coding
regions
have
nonrandom
sequence
characteristics
based
partly
on
codonusage
preferences
Empirically
it
is
found
that
statistics
of
hexanucleotides
perform
best
in
distinguishing
coding
from
noncoding
regions
Starting
from
a
set
of
known
genes
from
an
organism
as
a
training
set
patternrecognition
programs
can
be
tuned
to
particular
genomes
Accurate
gene
detection
is
a

Genomes
of
prokaryotes
The
genetic
material
of
most
prokaryotic
cells
takes
the
form
of
a
large
single
circular
piece
of
doublestranded
DNA
usually
less
than
5
Mb
long
In
addition
the
cells
may
contain
plasmids
The
proteincoding
regions
of
bacterial
genomes
do
not
contain
introns
In
many
prokaryotic
genomes
the
proteincoding
regions
are
partially
organized
into
operons
tandem
genes
transcribed
into
a
single
mRNA
molecule
under
common
transcriptional
control
In
bacteria
the
genes
of
many
operons
code
for
proteins
with
related
functions
For
instance
successive
genes
in
the
trp
operon
of
E
coli
code
for
proteins
that
catalyse
successive
steps
in
the
biosynthesis
of
tryptophan
see
Fig
21
In
archaea
a
metabolic
relationship
between
genes
in
operons
is
less
frequently
observed
Figure

The
trp
operon
in
E
coli
begins
with
a
control
region
containing
promoter
operator
and
leader
sequences
Five
structural
genes
encode
proteins
that
catalyse
successive
steps
in
the
synthesis
of
the
amino
acid
tryptophan
from
its
precursor
chorismate
Reaction
step
1
trpE
and
trpD
encode
two
components
of
anthranilate
synthase
This
tetrameric
enzyme
comprising
two
copies
of
each
subunit
catalyses
the
conversion
of
chorismate
to
anthranilate
Reaction
step
2
the
protein
encoded
by
trpD
also
catalyses
the
subsequent
phosphoribosylation
of
anthranilate
Reaction
step
3
trpC
encodes
another
bifunctional
enzyme
phosphoribosylanthranilate
isomeraseindoleglycerolphosphate
synthase
It
converts
phosphoribosyl
anthranilate
to
indoleglycerolphosphate
through
the
intermediate
carboxyphenylaminodeoxyribulose
phosphate
Reaction
steps
4
and
5
trpB
and
trpA
encode
the
and
subunits
respectively
of
a
third
bifunctional
enzyme
tryptophan
synthase
an
2
2
tetramer
A
tunnel
in
the
structure
of
this
enzyme
delivers
without
release
to
the
solvent
the
intermediate
produced
by
the
subunitindoleglycerolphosphate
to
indoleto
the
active
site
of
the
subunit
which
converts
indole
to
tryptophan
A
separate
gene
trpR
not
closely
linked
to
this
operon
codes
for
the
trp
repressor
The
repressor
can
bind
to
the
operator
sequence
in
the
DNA
within
the
control
region
only
when
binding
tryptophan
Binding
of
repressor
blocks
access
of
RNA
polymerase
to
the
promoter
turning
the
pathway
off
when
tryptophan
is
abundant
Further
control
of
transcription
in
response
to
tryptophan
levels
is
exerted
by
the
attenuator
element
in
the
mRNA
within
the
leader
sequence
The
attenuator
region
a
contains
two
tandem
trp
codons
and
b
can
adopt
alternative
secondary
structures
one
of
which
terminates
transcription
Levels
of
tryptophan
govern
levels
of
trp
tRNAs
which
govern
the
rate
of
progress
of
the
tandem
trp
codons
through
the
ribosome
Stalling
on
the
ribosome
at
the
tandem
trp
codons
in
response
to
low
tryptophan
levels
reduces
the
formation
of
the
mRNA
secondary
structure
that
terminates
transcription
The
typical
prokaryotic
genome
contains
only
a
relatively
small
amount
of
noncoding
DNA

of

Analysis

of

and
other

Many

from
the
many
years
of
intensive
investigation
1853
proteins
had
been
described
before

The

The
distribution
of
proteincoding
genes
over
the
genome
of
E
coli
does
not
seem
to
follow
any
simple
rules
either
along
the
DNA
or
on
different
strands
Indeed
comparison
of
strains
suggests
that
the
genes
are
mobile
The
E
coli
genome
is
relatively
gene
dense
Genes
coding
for
proteins
or
structural
RNAs
occupy
89
of
the
sequence
The
average
size
of
an
ORF
is
317
amino
acids
If
the
genes
were
evenly
distributed
the
average
intergenic
region
would
be
130
bp
the
observed
average
distance
between
genes
is
118
bp
However
the
sizes
of
intergenic
regions
vary
considerably
Some
intergenic
regions
are
large
These
contain
sites
of
regulatory
function
and
repeated
sequences
The
longest
intergenic
region
1730
bp
contains
noncoding
repeat
sequences
Approximately
threequarters
of
the
transcribed
units
contain
only
one
gene
the
rest
contain
several
consecutive
genes
or
operons
It
is
estimated
that
the
E
coli
genome
contains
630700
operons
Operons
vary
in
size
although
few
contain
more
than
five
genes
The
genes
in
operons
tend
to
have
related
functions
In
some
cases
the
same
DNA
sequence
encodes
parts
of
more
than
one
polypeptide
chain
One
gene
codes
for
both
the
and
subunits
of
DNA
polymerase
III
Translation
of
the
entire
gene
forms
the
subunit
The
subunit
corresponds
approximately
to
the
Nterminal
twothirds
of
the
subunit
A
frameshift
on
the
ribosome
at
this
point
leads
to
chain
termination
50
of
the
time
causing
a
11
ratio
of
expressed
and
subunits
There
do
not
appear
to
be
any
overlapping
genes
in
which
different
reading
frames
both
code
for
expressed
proteins
In
other
cases
the
same
polypeptide
chain
appears
in
more
than
one
enzyme
A
protein
that
functions
on
its
own
as
lipoate
dehydrogenase
is
also
an
essential
subunit
of
pyruvate
dehydrogenase
2oxoglutarate
dehydrogenase
and
the
glycine
cleavage
complex
Having
the
complete
genome
we
can
examine
the
protein
repertoire
of
E
coli
The
largest
class
of
proteins
is
the
enzymes
accounting
for
30
of
the
total
genes
Many
enzymatic
functions
are
shared
by
more
than
one
protein
Some
of
these
sets
of
functionally
similar
enzymes
are
very
closely
related
and
appear
to
have
arisen
by
duplication
either
in
E
coli
itself
or
in
an
ancestor
or
gene
donor
species
Other
sets
of
functionally
similar
enzymes
have
very
dissimilar
sequences
and
differ
in
specificity
regulation
or
intracellular
location
Several
features
of
E
coli
s
generous
endowment
of
enzymes
give
it
a
versatile
metabolic
competence
which
allow
it
to
grow
and
compete
under
varying
conditions
It
can
synthesize
all
components
of
proteins
and
nucleic
acids
amino
acids
and
nucleotides
and
cofactors
It
has
metabolic
flexibility
both
aerobic
and
anaerobic
growth
are
possible
utilizing
different
pathways
of
energy
capture
It
can
grow
on
many
different
carbon
sources
Not
all
metabolic
pathways
are
active
at
any
given
time
the
alternatives
allow
response
to
changes
in
conditions
102
Even
for
specific
metabolic
reactions
there
are
many
cases
of
multiple
enzymes
These
provide
redundancy
and
contribute
to
an
ability
to
tune
metabolism
to
varying
conditions
through
complementary
control
mechanisms
However
E
coli
does
not
possess
a
complete
range
of
enzymatic
capacity
It
cannot
fix
CO
2
or
N
2
We
have
described
here
some
of
the
static
features
of
the
E
coli
genome
and
its
protein
repertoire
Current
research
has
elucidated
dynamic
aspects
including
the
mechanisms
that
govern
protein
expression
patterns
in
time
and
space

The
genome
of
the
archaeon
Methanococcus
jannaschii
S
Luria
once
suggested
that
to
determine
common
features
of
all
life
one
should
not
try
to
survey
everything
but
rather
identify
the
organism
most
different
from
us
and
see
what
we
have
in
common
with
it
The
assumption
was
that
the
way
to
do
this
would
be
to
find
an
organism
adapted
to
the
most
different
environment
Deepsea
exploration
has
revealed
environments
as
far
from
the
familiar
as
those
portrayed
in
science
fiction
Hydrothermal
vents
are
underwater
volcanoes
emitting
hot
lava
and
gases
through
cracks
in
the
ocean
floor
They
create
niches
for
communities
of
living
things
disconnected
from
the
surface
which
depend
on
the
minerals
exuded
from
the
vent
as
inorganic
nutrients
They
support
living
communities
of
microorganisms
that
are
the
only
known
forms
of
life
not
dependent
on
sunlight
directly
or
indirectly
for
their
energy
source
The
microorganism
M
jannaschii
was
collected
from
a
hydrothermal
vent
2600
m
deep
off
the
coast
of
Baja
California
Mexico
in
1983
It
is
a
thermophilic
organism
surviving
at
temperatures
from
48
to
94C
with
an
optimum
at
85C
It
is
a
strict
anaerobe
capable
of
selfreproduction
from
inorganic
components
Its
overall
metabolic
equation
is
to
synthesize
methane
from
H
2
and
CO
2
M
jannaschii
belongs
to
the
archaea
one
of
the
three
major
divisions
of
life
along
with
the
bacteria
and
eukarya
see
Fig
12
The
archaea
comprise
groups
of
prokaryotes
including
organisms
adapted
to
extreme
environmental
conditions
such
as
high
temperature
and
pressure
or
high
salt
concentration
However
many
archaea
are
not
extremophiles
The
genome
of
M
jannaschii
was
sequenced
in
1996
by
The
Institute
for
Genomic
Research
TIGR
It
was
the
first
archaeal
genome
sequenced
It
contains
a
large
chromosome
containing
a
circular
doublestranded
DNA
molecule
of
1
664
976
bp
long
and
two
extrachromosomal
elements
of
58
407
and
16
550
bp
There
are
1784
predicted
proteincoding
regions
of
which
1728
are
on
the
chromosome
and
44
and
12
on
the
large
and
small
extrachromosomal
elements
respectively
Some
RNA
genes
contain
introns
As
in
other
prokaryotic
genomes
there
is
little
noncoding
DNA
M
jannaschii
would
appear
to
satisfy
Lurias
goal
of
finding
our
most
distant
extant
relative
Comparison
of
its
genome
sequence
with
others
shows
that
it
is
distantly
related
to
other
forms
of
life
Only
42
of
the
genes
have
been
assigned
a
function
However
to
everyones
great
surprise
archaea
are
in
some
ways
more
closely
related
to
eukarya
than
to
bacteria
They
are
a
complex
mixture
In
archaea
proteins
involved
in
transcription
translation
and
regulation
are
more
similar
to
those
of
eukarya
Archaeal
proteins
involved
in
metabolism
are
more
similar
to
those
of
bacteria
The
genome
of
one
of
the
simplest
organisms
Mycoplasma
genitalium
103M
genitalium
is
an
infectious
bacterium
the
cause
of
nongonococcal
urethritis
Its
genome
was
sequenced
in
1995
by
a
collaboration
of
groups
at
TIGR
Johns
Hopkins
University
and
the
University
of
North
Carolina
The
genome
is
a
single
DNA
molecule
containing
580
070
bp
At
the
time
this
was
the
smallest
cellular
genome
yet
sequenced
So
far
is
the
closest
we
have
to
a
minimal
organism
the
smallest
capable
of
independent
life
Viruses
in
contrast
require
the
cellular
machinery
of
their
hosts
The
genome
is
dense
in
coding
regions
468
genes
have
been
identified
as
expressed
proteins
Some
regions
of
the
sequence
are
generich
others
genepoor
but
overall
85
of
the
sequence
is
coding
The
average
length
of
a
coding
region
is
1040
bp
As
in
other
bacterial
genomes
the
coding
regions
do
not
contain
introns
Further
compression
of
the
genome
is
achieved
by
overlapping
genes
It
appears
that
many
of
these
have
arisen
through
loss
of
stop
codons
The
gene
repertoire
of
M
genitalium
includes
some
that
encode
proteins
essential
for
independent
reproduction
such
as
those
involved
in
DNA
replication
transcription
and
translation
plus
ribosomal
and
transfer
RNAs
Other
genes
are
specific
for
the
infectious
activity
including
adhesins
that
mediate
binding
to
infected
cells
other
molecules
for
defence
against
the
hosts
immune
system
and
a
large
number
of
transport
proteins
As
an
adaptation
to
the
parasitic
lifestyle
of
the
organism
there
has
been
widespread

metabolic
enzymes

Metagenomics
the
collection
of
genomes
in
a
coherent
environmental
sample
Classically
the
goal
of
microbiology
was
the
identification
of
pathogenic
organisms
responsible
for
infectious
disease
Isolation
and
cloning
of
pure
strains
facilitated
diagnosis
and
allowed
testing
of
drugs
Powerful
as
the
methods
were
and
important
as
they
were
for
clinical
applications
they
were
also
blinders
that
prevented
full
appreciation
of
the
variety
and
interactions
of
species
in
natural
environments
Indeed
it
is
the
lack
of
independence
under
natural
conditions
of
many
species
that
makes
it
impossible
to
clone
them
Conversely
study
of
entire
microbial
communities
is
essential
to
illuminate
general
principles
of
ecology
and
evolution
From
natural
samples
containing
complex
mixtures
it
is
possible
to
determine
sequences
directly
without
culturing
individual
strains
This
provides
access
to
information
about
species
that
cannot
be
cloned
in
the
traditional
way
A
millilitre
of
ocean
water
may
contain
100200
species
A
gram
of
soil
may
contain
4000
The
human
gut
contains
on
the
order
of
500
different
species
of
microorganisms
although
10
of
those
species
probably
account
for
99
of
the
total
bacterial
population
In
addition
to
prokaryotes
many
natural
samples
contain
a
rich
mixture
of
viruses
Subjects
of

Subjects

Application

to

very
large

Sequencing
of

from
the

genes
from
5677
Gb
of
sequence
data
These
numbers
are
more
than
impressive
they
are
daunting
Recognize
that
the
data
are
noisy
fragmented
and
arise
from
a
complex
mixture
of
sources
A
crucial
feature
the
read
length
depends
on
the
sequencing
technique
used
For
many
metagenomic
data
sets
it
is
not
possible
to
assemble
complete
genomes
However
it
is
often
possible
to
perform
BLAST
searches
on
the
fragments
to
identify
source
and
in
cases
of
proteincoding
sequencesfunction
This
can
be
enough
to
estimate
an
inventory
of
which
species
are
present
and
in
what
proportions
Comparative
studies
can
clarify
spatial

Even
worse
viruses
do
not

should
live
in
dire
fear

marine

Recall
the
famous
story
of
subsequent
Nobel
laureate
Barry
Marshall
To
prove
that
H
pylori
caused
peptic
ulcers
in
the
face
of
a
consensus
of
disbelief
Marshall
ingested
a
sample
and
induced
the
disease
in
himself
Another
illuminating
anecdote
describes
a
patient
with
a
recalcitrant
unilateral
ear
infection
After
physicians
tried
everything
in
their
armamentarium
the
patient
cured
himself
by
transplanting
a
sample
of
earwax
and
its
associated
microflora
from
his
good
ear
to
the
infected
one
What
is
perhaps
misleading
about
these
examples
is
that
the
human
microbiome
is
complex
and
its
variation
in
health
and
disease
may
in
general
be
far
more
subtle
The

Biotechnology
although
the
core
of
metabolism
is
common
to
most
life
forms
individual
species
develop
unusual
enzymes
that
are
applicable
to
synthesis
of
useful
products
on
the
industrial
scale
This
includes
but
is
not
limited
to
the
development
of
economic
alternative
energy
sources
For
instance
leafcutter
ants
harbour
symbiotic
bacteria
that
effectively
degrade
cellulose
and
lignin
to
sugars
which
can
be
fermented
to
ethanol
for

The
human
microbiome
The
human
body
contains
several
ecological
niches
that
harbour
flourishing
microbial
communities
These
include
internal
habitats
such
as
the
gut
and
exposed
regions
such
as
the
skin
and
nasal
mucosa
which
more
readily
exchange
microorganisms
with
the
environment
In
all
the
microbiome
contains
about
10
times
as
many
cells
as
human
cells
contributing
several
kilograms
of
body
weight
these
cells
contain
millions
of
genes
dwarfing
the
21
000
of
the
human
genome
excluding
the
immune
system
Recognition
of
the
significance
of
the
human
microbiome
in
health
and
disease
is
a
recent
development
Many
people
feel
that
its
importance
continues
to
be
seriously
underestimated
The
large
number
of
new
discoveries
in
this
field
support
this
point
of
view
The
US
National
Institutes
of
Health
has
established
the
Human
Microbiome
Project
to
characterize
the
microorganisms
living
in
and
on
our
bodies
and
to
determine
their
roles
in
health
and
disease
What
are
the
biodiversities
and
structures
of
these
microbial
communities
How
do
they
interact
with
one
another
and
with
the
surroundings
How
do
they
vary
from
individual
to
individual
from
place
to
place
on
Earth
How
do
they
reveal
and
contribute
to
health
and
disease
Altogether
human
microbiome
projects
have
identified
30
humanassociated
bacterial
phyla
less
than
half
of
all
known
bacterial
phyla
51
classes
125
orders
493
families
and
939
genera
The
distribution
is
highly
skewed
most
sites
in
the
body
show
a
few
dominant
species
and
a
tail
of
rare
ones
The
distribution
differs
from
external
environments
such
as
soil
and
sea
showing
that
we
are
not
merely
reflecting
our
surroundings
For
instance
the
human
microbiome
is
rich
in
Firmicutes
Actinobacteria
Proteobacteria
and
Bacteriodetes
in
contrast
Firmicutes
are
rarer
in
external
environments
Different
habitats
on
and
within
the
human
body
are
characterized
by
different
patterns
of
microflora
Different
sites
show
different
persontoperson
variation
For
example
the
mouth
shows
the
least
variation
among
individuals
The
mouth
flora
is
also
the
most
stable
when
remeasured
at
intervals
of
several
months
Clinical
applications
of
the
human
microbiome
project
depend
on
recognizing
the
effects
of
microflora
on
health
and
disease
In
addition
to
the
H
pylori
ulcer
connection
gut

are
known
to
be
involved
in
irritable
bowel
syndrome
Crohn
disease
ulcerative
colitis
and
a
variety
of
gastrointestinal

Two
specific
mechanisms
affecting
human
health
are
1
bacteria
in
the
gut
metabolizing
dietary
choline
to
produce
a
substance
leading
to
arteriosclerosis
and
thereby
cardiovascular
disease
Antibiotic

2
bacteria
in
the
gut
metabolizing

Eggerthella

The

between

and
complexity
of

is
very
rough
It
certainly
does
not
support
any
preconception
that

In
many
cases
differences
in
genome
size
reflect
different
amounts
of
simple

In
addition
to
variation
in
DNA
content
eukaryotic
species
vary
in
the
number
of
chromosomes
and
distribution
of
genes
among
them
Some
differences
in
the
distribution
of
genes
among
chromosomes
involve
translocations
or
chromosome
fragmentations
or
joinings
For

humans
have
23

A

Gene
families
In
addition
to
duplications
of
entire
chromosomes
duplications
of
individual
genes
are
common
as
a
result
of
unequal
crossing
over
Therefore
gene
families
on
single
chromosomes
are
common
in
eukarya
Some
family
members
are
paralogues
related
genes
that
have
diverged
to
provide
separate
functions
in
the
same
species
Orthologues
in
contrast
are
homologues
that
perform
the
same
function
in
different
species
For
instance
human
and
globin
are
paralogues
and
human
and
horse
myoglobin
are
orthologues
Other
related
sequences
may
be
pseudogenes
which
may
have
arisen
by
duplication
or
by
retrotransposition
from
mRNA
followed
by
the
accumulation
of
mutations
to
the
point
of
loss
of
function
The
human
globin
gene
cluster
is

The

clusters
Human
haemoglobin
genes
and
pseudogenes
appear
in
clusters
on
chromosomes
11
and

The

synthesizes
primarily
three
types
of
globin
chain
and
chains
which
assemble
into
haemoglobin

tetramers
and
myoglobin
a
monomeric
protein
found
in

Other
forms
of
haemoglobin
encoded
by
different
genes
are
synthesized
in
the
embryonic
and
foetal
stages
of
life
Other
globins

kbp
It
includes
five
functional
genes
two
genes
G
and
A
which
differ
in
one
amino
acid
and
and
one
pseudogene
The
genes
for
myoglobin
neuroglobin
and
cytoglobin
are
unlinked
from
both
of
these
clusters
All
human
haemoglobin
and
myoglobin
genes
have
the
same
intronexon
structure
They
contain
three
exons
separated
by
two
introns
Here
E
means
exon
and
I
means
intron
The
lengths
of
the
regions
in
this
figure
reflect
the
human
globin
gene
This
exonintron
pattern
is
conserved
in
most
expressed
vertebrate
globin
genes
including
haemoglobin
and
chains
and
myoglobin
In
contrast
the
genes
for
plant
globins
have
an
additional
intron
genes
for
Paramecium
globins
have
one

The
gene
for
human
neuroglobin
a
homologue
expressed
at

The
distribution
of
haemoglobin
genes
and

on
the
chromosomes
appears
to
reflect
their
evolution
via
duplication
and

111The
expression
of
these
genes
follows
a
strict
developmental
pattern
In
the
embryo
up
to
6
weeks
after
conception
two
haemoglobin
chains
are
primarily
synthesized
and
which
form
a

tetramer
Between

about
8

the
predominant
species
This

Thalassaemias
are
genetic
diseases
associated
with
defective
or
deleted
haemoglobin
genes
Most
caucasian
people
have
four
genes
for
the
chain
of
normal
adult
haemoglobin
two
alleles
of
each
of
the
two
tandem
genes
1
and
2
Therefore
thalassaemias
can
present
clinically
in
different
degrees
of
severity
depending
on
how
many
genes
express
normal
chains
Only
deletions
leaving
fewer
than
two
active
genes
present
as
symptomatic
under
normal
conditions
Observed
genetic
defects
include
deletions
of
both
genes
a
process
made
more
probable
by
the
tandem
gene
arrangement
and
repetitive
sequences
which
make
crossing
over
more
likely
and
loss
of
chain
termination
leading
to
transcriptional
read
through
creating
extended
polypeptide
chains
that
are
unstable
Thalassaemias
are
usually
point
mutations
including
missense
mutations
amino
acid
substitutions
or
nonsense
mutations
changes
from
a
triplet
coding
for
an
amino
acid
to
a
stop
codon
leading
to
premature
termination
and
a
truncated
protein
mutations
in
splice
sites
or
mutations
in
regulatory
regions
Certain
deletions
including
the
normal
termination
codon
and
the
intergenic
region
between
and
genes
create
fusion
proteins
over
an
order
of
magnitude
from
the
1352

A

The

The
nematode
worm
C

entered
biological
research
in
the
1960s
at
the
express
invitation
of
Sydney
Brenner
He
recognized
its
potential
as
an
organism
sufficiently
complex
to
be
interesting
yet
simple
enough
to
permit
complete
analysis
at
the
cellular
level
of
its
genetics
development
and
neural
circuitry
The
C
elegans
genome
completed
in
1998
provided
the
first
full
DNA
sequence
of
a
multicellular
organism
The
C

From

Science
volume
282
dated

December
1998
Several
kinds
of
RNA
genes
have
been
identified
The
C
elegans
genome
contains
659
genes
for
tRNA
almost
half
of
them
44
on
the
X
chromosome
Spliceosomal
RNAs
appear
in
dispersed
copies
often
identical
Spliceosomes
are
the
organelles
that
convert
premRNA
transcripts
to
mature
mRNA
by
excising
introns
and
stitching
the
exons
together
rRNAs
appear
in
a
long
tandem
array
at
the
end
of
chromosome
I
5S
RNAs
appear
in
a
tandem
array
on
chromosome
V
Some
RNA
genes
appear
in
introns
of
proteincoding
genes
The
C
elegans
genome
contains
many
repeat
sequences
Approximately
26
of
the
genome
consists
of
tandem
repeats
Approximately
36
of
the
genome
contains
inverted
repeats
these
appear
preferentially
within
introns
rather
than
between
genes
Repeats
of
the
hexamer
sequence
TTAGGC
appear
in
many
places
There
are
also
simple
duplications
involving
hundreds
to
tens
of
thousands
of
kilobases
The
genome
of
Drosophila
melanogaster
D
melanogaster
the
fruit
fly
has
been
the
subject
of
detailed
studies
of
genetics
and
development
for
almost
a
century
Its
genome
sequence
the
product
of
a
collaboration
between
Celera
Genomics
and
the
Berkeley
Drosophila
Genome
Project
was
announced
in
1999
The
chromosomes
of
D
melanogaster
are
nucleoprotein
complexes
with
variation
in
their
structure
along
their
lengths
Approximately
onethird
of
the
genome
is
contained
in
heterochromatin
highly
coiled
and
compact
and
therefore
densely
staining
regions
flanking
the
centromeres
The
other
twothirds
is
euchromatin
a
relatively
uncoiled
less
compact
form
Most
of
the
active
genes
are
in
the
euchromatin
The
heterochromatin
in
D
melanogaster
contains
many
tandem
repeats
of
the
sequence
AATAACATAG
and
relatively
few
genes
The
total
chromosomal
DNA
of
D
melanogaster
contains
about
180
Mbp
The
sequence
released
in
1999
consists
of
the
euchromatic
portion
about
120
Mbp
In
2007
an
additional
15
Mbp
of
heterochromatin
sequence
was
assembled
The
genome
is
distributed
over
five
chromosomes
three
large
autosomes
a
Y
chromosome
and
a
114fifth
tiny
chromosome
containing
only
1
Mbp
of
euchromatin
The
flys
13
601
genes
are
approximately
double
the
number
in
yeast
but
are
fewer
than
in
C
elegans
perhaps
a
surprise
The
average
density
of
genes
in
the
euchromatin
sequence
is
1
gene9
kb
much
lower
than
the
typical
1
genekb
densities
of
prokaryotic
genomes
The
heterochromatin
contains
at
least
250
proteincoding
genes
They
differ
from
typical
euchromatic
proteincoding
genes
by
containing
longer
introns
Most
of
the
intron
sequences
are
repetitive
predominantly
fragmented
transposable
elements
Despite
the
fact
that
insects
are
not
very
closely
related
to
mammals
the
fly
genome
is
useful
in
the
study
of
human
disease
It
contains
homologues
of
289
human
genes
implicated
in
various
diseases
including
cancer
and
cardiovascular
neurological
endocrinological
renal
metabolic
and
haematological
diseases
Some
of
these
homologues
have
different
functions
in
humans
and
flies
Other
human
diseaseassociated
genes
can
be
introduced
into
and
studied
in
the
fly
For
instance
the
gene
for
human
spinocerebellar
ataxia
type
3
when
expressed
in
the
fly
produces
similar
neuronal
cell
degeneration
There
are
now
fly
models
for
Parkinsons
disease
and
malaria
The
noncoding
regions
of
the
D
melanogaster
genome
must
contain
regions
controlling
spatiotemporal
patterns
of
development
The
developmental
biology
of
the
fly
has
been
studied
very
intensively
It
is
therefore
an
organism
in
which
the
study
of
the
genomics
of
development
should
prove
extremely
informative
The
genome
of
Arabidopsis
thaliana
As
a
flowering
plant
A
thaliana
is
a
very
distant
relative
of
most
other
higher
eukaryotic
organisms
for
which
genome
sequences
are
available
It
invites
comparative
analysis
to
identify
common
and
specialized
features
A
thaliana
has
a
relatively
small
genome146
Mbdistributed
over
five
chromosomes
The
maize
genome
is
almost
20
times
larger
The
compact
genome
was
one
reason
for
the
adoption
of
Arabidopsis
as
a
research
species
A
thaliana
is
called
the
fruit
fly
of
botany
The
Arabidopsis
Genome
Initiative
reported
1154
Mbp
of
genomic
DNA
sequence
in
2000
There
are
five
pairs
of
chromosomes
containing
25
498
predicted
genes
see
Table
26
The
genome
is
relatively
compact
with
1
gene46
kb
on
average
This
figure
is
intermediate
between
prokaryotes
and
Drosophila
and
roughly
similar
to
C
elegans
The
genes
of
Arabidopsis
are
relatively
small
Exons
are
typically
250
bp
long
and
introns
relatively
small
with
a
mean

The
A

Most
Arabidopsis
proteins
have
homologues
in
animals
but
some
systems
are
unique
among
higher
organisms
to
plants
These
include
cell
wall
production
and
photosynthesis
It
might
be
expected
that
these
need
special
proteins
that
might
not
be
shared
with
animals
Many
proteins
shared
with
animals
have
diverged
widely
since
the
last
common
ancestor
Typical
of
another
difference
between
plants
and
animals
25

The
Arabidopsis
nuclear
genome
is
relatively
compact
Proteincoding
genes
contain
an
average
of
54
exons
and
have
an
average
length
276
bp
separated
by
relatively
short
introns
of
about
165
bp
long
The
intergenic

is

A
feature
of
plant

is
that
the

is
higher
than
that
of
introns

The
structure
of
the
A
thaliana
genome
reveals
both
local
and
genomewide
duplications
There
were
at
least
three
polyploidizations
estimates
for
the
dates
of
which
vary
widely
The

for
the

and
2540
million

for
the
most
recent
have
been
suggested
In
addition
local
duplications
have
affected
17
of
genes
Close
relatives
such
as
cabbage
and
cauliflower
have
undergone
additional
polyploidizations
during
the
12
million
years
since
they
diverged
from
Arabidopsis
Higher

Many

and

appear
to
have
originated
in
the
organelles
and
been
transferred
to
the

Genome
analysis
must
address
questions
of
divisions
of
labour
Relative
to
animal
cells
organelles
in
plant
cells
bear
a
greater
metabolic
burden
if
only
because
of
the
activities
of
chloroplasts
Chloroplast
genomes
are
relatively
genedense
with
preserved
gene
order
In
plant
mitochondria
genes
are
more
widely
spaced
and
recombination
is
more
common
Mitochondrial
and
chloroplast
genes
contain
fewer
introns
as
shown
here
The
Arabidopsis
proteome
contains
many
genes
specific
to
plants
including
those
involved
in
photosynthesis
and
metabolism
of
cell
wall
components
Plants
have
many
special
metabolic
pathways
for
photosynthesis
and
for
metabolism
of
cell
wall
components
alkaloids
and
growth
regulators
such
as
auxins
and
gibberelins
Complex
metabolism
requires
the
genome
to
encode
a
large
and
varied
set
of
enzymes
Plants
are
threatened
by
pathogens
and
have
evolved
defence
mechanisms
dissimilar
from
our
immune
system
One
weapon
against
pathogens
involves
production
of
reactive
oxygen
species
Plants
synthesize
some
defence
molecules
against
animals
and
others
that
attract
pollinators
These
have
provided
useful
sources
of
flavours
fragrances
and
drugs
encompassing
traditional
herbal
medicine
and
modern
pharmacology
In
keeping
with
the
essential
role
of
light
in
plant
life
Arabidopsis
has
many
light
sensors
that
regulate
development
and
circadian
responses
116
Arabidopsis
is
rich
in
genes
that
encode
watertransporting
channels
peptide
hormone
transporters
metabolic
and
biosynthetic
enzymes
and
proteins
involved
in
defence
detoxification
and
environmental
sensing
Comparing
the
proteins
encoded
in
the
nuclear
genome
of
Arabidopsis
with
human
proteins
the
fraction
of
homologues
observed
varies
with
functional
category
For
protein
synthesis
60
of
nuclearencoded
Arabidopsis
genes
have
human
homologues
For
transcription
regulation
the
figure
is
only
30
It
is
not
that
transcription
is
poorly
represented
in
plant
genomes
its
just
that
plants
do
it
differently
In
fact
plants
have
several
times
as
many
transcription
factors
as
the
fruit
fly
Although
many
components
of
the
signal
transduction
pathways
familiar
from
animals
are
absent
in
plants
plants
have
developed
specific
transcription
factor
families
unknown
in
animals
Many
Arabidopsis
genes
are
homologous
to
human
genes
implicated
in
disease
For
instance
plants
and
animals
have
similar
DNArepair
systems
and
Arabidopsis
has
a
homologue
of
BRCA2
For
some
humandiseaseassociated
genes
the
plant
homologue
is
more
similar
to
the
human
protein
than
those
from
fruit
fly
or
C
elegans
Study
of
the
function
of
the
plant
homologues
will
be
illuminating
even
though
it
is
unlikely
that

will
be
suitable
for

Preface
to
The
Adventures
of
Huckleberry
Finn
In
February
2001
the
International
Human
Genome
Sequencing
Consortium
and
Celera
Genomics
published
separately
drafts
of
the
human
genome
On
14
April
2003
the
finishing
of
the
genome
was
announced
with
reduced
error
rate
and
closure
of
most
gaps
This
date
was
within
a
few
days
of
the
fiftieth
anniversary
of
the
publication
of
the
WatsonCrick
model
for
the
structure
for
DNA
The
sequence
amounts
to
about
32
10
9
bp
30
times
larger
than
the
genomes
of
C
elegans
or
D
melanogaster
One
reason
for
this
disparity
in
size
is
that
coding
sequences
form
less
than
5
of
the
human
genome
and
repeat
sequences
over
50
Perhaps
the
most
surprising
feature
was
the
small
number
of
genes
identified
The
finding
of
only
about
20
00025
000
genes
suggests
that
alternative
splicing
patterns
make
a
very
significant
contribution
to
our
protein
repertoire
It
is
estimated
that
35
of
human
genes
have
alternative
splicing
patterns
The
human
genome
is
distributed
over
22
chromosome
pairs
plus
the
X
and
Y
chromosomes
The
DNA
contents
of
the
autosomes
range
from
279
down
to
48
Mbp
The
X
chromosome
contains
163
Mbp
and
the
Y
chromosome
only
51
Mbp
The
exons
of
human
proteincoding
genes
are
relatively
small
compared
to
those
in
other
known
eukaryotic
genomes
The
introns
are
relatively
long
As
a
result
many
proteincoding
genes
span
long
stretches
of
DNA
For
instance
the
dystrophin
gene
coding
for
a
3685
amino
acid
protein
is
more
than
24
Mbp
long
Proteincoding
genes
Analysis
of
the
human
protein
repertoire
implied
by
the
genome
sequence
has
proved
difficult
117because
of
the
problems
in
detecting
genes
reliably
and
because
of
alternative
splicing
patterns

the
estimated
20

Many
of
the
differences
between
individuals
have
the
form
of
singlenucleotide
polymorphisms
or
SNPs
There
are
also
many
short
deletions
A
SNP
pronounced
snip
is
a
genetic
variation
between
individuals
limited
to
a
single
base
pair
that
can
be
substituted
inserted
or
deleted
Sicklecell
anaemia
is
an
example
of
a
disease
caused
by
a
specific
SNP
an
A
T
mutation
in
the
globin
gene
changes
a
Glu
to
a
Val
creating
a
sticky
surface
on
the
haemoglobin
molecule
that
leads
to
polymerization
of
the
deoxy
form
Not
all
SNPs
are
linked
to
diseases
Many
are
not
within
functional
regions
although
the
density
of
SNPs
is
higher
than
the
average
in
regions
containing
genes
Some
SNPs
that
occur
within
exons
are
mutations
to
synonymous
codons
or
cause
substitutions
that
do
not
significantly
affect
protein
function
Other
types
of
SNP
can
cause
more
than
local
perturbation
to
a
protein

a
mutation
from
a
sense
codon
to
a
stop
codon
or
vice
versa
will
cause
either
premature
truncation
of

or

may
cause

The
A
B
and
O
alleles
of
the
genes
for
blood
groups
illustrate
these
possibilities
A
and
B
alleles
differ
by
four
SNP
substitutions
They
code
for
related
proteins
that
add
different
saccharide
units
to
an
antigen

the

of

cells

The
O

has

causing
a

and
produces
no
active
enzyme
The
120red
blood
cells
of
type
O
individuals
contain
neither
the
A
nor
the
B
antigen
This
is
why
people
with
type
O
blood
are
universal
donors
in
blood
transfusions
The
loss
of
activity
of
the
protein
does
not
seem
to
carry
any
adverse
consequences
Indeed
individuals
of
blood
types
B
and
O
have
greater
resistance
to
smallpox
Strong
correlation
of
a
disease
with
a
specific
SNP
is
advantageous
in
clinical
work
because
it
is
relatively
easy
to
test
for
affected
people
or
carriers
But
if
a
disease
arises
from
dysfunction
of
a
specific
protein
there
ought
to
be
many
sites
of
mutations
that
could
cause
inactivation
However
a
particular
site
may
predominate
if
1
all
bearers
of
the
gene
are
descendants
of
a
single
individual
in
whom
the
mutation
occurred
andor
2
the
disease
results
from
a
gain
rather
than
loss
of
a
specific
property
such
as
in
the
ability
of
sicklecell
haemoglobin
to
polymerize
andor
3
the
mutation
rate
at
a
particular
site
is
unusually
high
as
in
the
380
Gly
Arg
mutation
in
the
fibroblast
growth
receptor
gene
FGFR3
associated
with
achondroplasia
a
syndrome
including
short
stature
In
contrast
many
independent
mutations
have
been
detected
in
the
BRCA1
and
BRCA2
genes
loci
associated
with
increased
disposition
to
earlyonset
breast
and
ovarian
cancer
The
normal
gene
products
function
as
tumour
suppressors
Insertion
or
deletion
mutants
causing
phase
shifts
generally
produce
a
missing
or
inactive
protein
But
it
cannot
be
deduced
a
priori
whether
a
novel
substitution
mutant
in
BRCA1
or
BRCA2
confers
increased
risk
or
not
Treatments
of
diseases
caused
by
defective
or
absent
proteins
include
the
following

Providing
normal
protein
We
have
mentioned
insulin
for
diabetes
and
Factor
VIII
in
the
most
common
type
of
haemophilia
Another
example
is
the
administration
of
human
growth
hormone
in
patients
with
an
absence
or
severe
reduction
in
normal
levels
Use
of
recombinant
proteins
eliminates
the
risk
of
transmission
of
AIDS
through
blood
transfusions
or
of
CreutzfeldJakob
disease
from
growth
hormone
isolated
from
crude
pituitary

Lifestyle

that
make

function
unnecessary
Phenylketonuria
PKU
is
a
genetic
disease
caused
by
deficiency
in
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
the
enzyme
that
converts
phenylalanine
to
tyrosine
Accumulation
of
high
levels
of
phenylalanine
causes
developmental
defects
including
mental
retardation
The
symptoms
can
be
avoided
by
a
phenylalaninefree
diet
Screening
of
newborns
for
high
blood
phenylalanine
levels
is
legally
required
in
the
USA
and
many
other
countries

SNPs
are

throughout
the
genome
occurring
on
the
average
every
2000
bp
Although
they
arose
by
mutation
many
positions
containing
SNPs
have
low
mutation
rates
and
provide
stable
markers
for
mapping
genes
Each
of
us
bears
an
accumulated
collection
of
SNPs
reflecting
mutations
that
occurred
in
our
ancestors
Some
constellations
of
SNPs
are
coinherited
as
blocks
Others
are
not
mutations
in
different
DNA
molecules
of
diploid
chromosomes
become
separated
within
a
single
generation
by
assortment
Mutations
on
the
same
chromosome
become
separated
more
slowly
by
recombination
Haploid
sequences
such
as
the
most
of
the
human
Y
chromosome
or
mitochondrial
DNA
are
not
121subject
to
recombination
Mutations
in
these
sequences
remain
together
Mutations
in
the
same
DNA
molecule
in
diploid
chromosomes
will
become
unlinked
by
recombination
events
that
occur
between
their
loci
The
greater
the
separation
between
two
sites
the
greater
the
frequency
of
recombination
However
recombination
rates
vary
widely
along
the
genome
by
several
orders
of
magnitude
SNPs
on
opposite
sides
of
recombinational
hot
spots
are
more
likely
to
be
separated
in
any
generation
SNPs
lying
within
recombinationpoor
cold
regions
will
tend
to
stay
together
Haplotypes
are
local
combinations
of
genetic
polymorphisms
that
tend
to
be
coinherited
In
humans
many
100
kb
regions
tend
to
remain
intact
They
show
the
expected
number
of
SNPs
but
relatively
few
of
the
possible
combinations
An
average
SNP
density
of

or
1
SNPkb
suggests
100
SNPs
per
100
kb
The
genome
of
any
individual
may
possess
or
may
lack
each
of
them
giving

very
large
number

of
possible

However
many

show
fewer
than

of

Haplotypes

economical
characterization
of

genomes
They
simplify
the
search
for
genes
responsible
for

or
any
other

correlations
For
field
biologists
including
anthropologists
haplotypes
permit
detection
of
migratory
and
interbreeding
patterns
in
populations
In
looking
for
genes
responsible
for
diseases
or
other
phenotypic
traits
haplotypes
provide
a
magnifying
glass
The
goal
is
to
correlate
phenotype
with
genetic
sequence
The
target
may
be
to
identify
one
base

By
correlating

to
localize
the
site
to
within
the
typical
length
of
a
haplotype
block
perhaps
100
kb
containing
only
a
few
genes
Another
way
to
look
at
it
is
to
regard
boundaries
between
haplotype
blocks
as
like
the

in
a

many
100

show
only
a

two
to
four
of
the
possible
combinations
of

that
recombination
is
rare
within

These

which
remain

are
separated
by
intervals
in

The

The

curates

from

human

Haplotypes
are
difficult
to
measure
because
it
is
essential
to
determine
which
SNPs
appear
in
the

DNA
strand
Clearly

of

from

can
determine
the
frequencies
of

SNPs
but
not
their

into
haplotypes
Even
a

the

of
both
copies
of

The
work
of
the

together
with

shows
that
most
of
the
variations
appear
in
all
populations
sampled
Some
of
the
interpopulation
differences
reflect
different
relative
amounts
of
the
same
SNPs
however
a
very
few
SNPs
are
unique
to
particular
populations
For
example
out
of
over
1

SNPs
only
11
are
consistently
different
between
all
individuals
of
European
origin
in

in

the

of
individuals
from

are
very

than
other

of

in
the

the

social

Informed

The

involved
not
only
individual

also
community

including
interactive

of

Samples

more

in
some
ways
to
the

the

Knowledge

More
controversial

arise
in

those
who
are

Most
people
would
have
no
problem
accepting
a
scheme
that
would
make
it
easier
to
identify
victims
of

on

or
after
a
terrorist
attack
Questions
have
been
raised
however
over
privacy
issues
Should
inclusion
of
genomic
information
in
a
data
bank
require
the
individuals
consent
What
data
should
be
included
Should
the
data
be
limited
to
the
minimum
required
for
standard
identification
procedures
or
be
more
extensive
For
instance
should
sufficient
additional
data
be
kept
to
identify
physical
features
or
ethnic
characteristics
Who
should
have
access
to
the
information
In
the
UK
and
USA
at
least
legislation
is
moving
in
the
direction
of
greater
protection
for
the
privacy
of
DNA
sequence
information
Belief
in
this
protection
which
may
well
be
illusory
could
lead
to
increased
genetic
testing
both
in
medical
practice
and
by
private
companies
But
1
as
with
mailing
lists
testing
companies
may
sell
genetic
information
to
outside
parties
2
given
the
increased
degree
of
international
sharing
of
identification
information
individuals
need
to
be
concerned
not
with
the
countries
with
the
most
secure
databases
but
those
with
the
least
secure
ones
and
3
experience
has
shown
that
much
private
information
in
fact
becomes
disseminated
through
either
accident
or
design
Indeed
many
researchers
have
thought
that
adequate
protection
would
be
afforded
by
construction
of
a
database
correlating
clinical
information
with
genome
sequences
keeping
both
sets
of
data
anonymous
However
it
has
recently
emerged
that
by
combining
the
putatively
anonymous
data
from
the
1000
Genomes
project
with
sequence
information
available
from
pop
genealogy
sites
the
124anonymity
could
be
broken
fairly
easily
Genetic
diversity
in
anthropology
SNP
data
are
of
great
utility
in
anthropology
giving
clues
to
historical
variations
in
population
size
and
migration
patterns
Degrees
of
genetic
diversity
are
interpretable
in
terms
of
the
size
of
the
founding
population
Founders
are
the
original
set
of
individuals
from
whom
an
entire
population
is
descended
Founders
can
be
either
original
colonists
such
as
the
Polynesians
who
first
settled
New
Zealand
or
merely
the
survivors
of
a
nearextinction
Cheetahs
show
the
effects
of
a
population
bottleneck
estimated
to
have
occurred
10
000
years
ago
All
living
cheetahs
are
as
closely
related
to
one
another
as
siblings
Extrapolations
of
mitochondrial
DNA
variation
in
contemporary
humans
suggest
a
single
maternal
ancestor
who
lived
140

years
ago
Calling
her
Eve
suggests
that
she
was
the
first
woman
But
fossil
evidence
for
humanlike
ancestors
reaches
back
much
longer
Mitochondrial
Eve
was
the
founder
of
a
surviving
population
following
a
nearextinction
There
is
now
consensus
that
our
species
H
sapiens
arose
in
Africa
approximately
100
000150
000
years
ago
The
evidence
for
human
origins
in
Africa
is
that
contemporary
genetic
diversity
is
highest
there

Human
mitochondrial
DNA
is
a
doublestranded
closed
circular
molecule
16
569
bp
long
It
is
inherited
almost
exclusively
through
maternal
lines
A
fertilized
egg
contains
the
mothers
mitochondria
Although
sperm
contain
mitochondriaessential
to
provide
energy
for
their
motilitythe
few
paternal
mitochondria
that
enter
the
egg
are
selectively
eliminated
As
a
haploid
entity
mitochondrial
DNA
is
therefore
not
subject
to
recombination
and
changes
only
by
mutation
Mitochondrial
DNA
is
estimated
to
adopt
one
mutation
every
25
000
years
This
gives
a
reasonable
rate
of
divergence
to
trace
human
migration
patterns
Nuclear
DNA
mutates
approximately
10
times
more
slowly
than
mitochondrial
DNA
because
1
histones
protect
it
2
active
repair
mechanisms
edit
out
some
mutations
and
3
the
activity
of
mitochondria
in
respiration

the
DNA
to
mutagenic
oxygen
radicals
Human
mitochondrial
DNA
contains
genes
for
22
tRNAs
two
rRNAs
and
13
proteins
The
major
noncoding
region
is
the
control
region
or
Dloop
involved
in
regulation
and
initiation
of
replication
This
region
is
about
1
kb
long
It
shows
a
higher
rate
of
substitution
than
the
rest
of
the
mitochondrial
genome
by
a
factor
of
about
4
Different
mitochondrial
DNA
sequences
are
associated
with
different
populations
Mutations
are
referred
to
the
first
human
mitochondrial
DNA
sequence
determined
called
the
Cambridge
Reference
Sequence
Groups
of
related
sequences
are
called
haplogroups
The
distribution
of
the
number
of
sequence
differences
between
different
individuals
has
peaks
at
70
for
Africans
and
30
for
nonAfricans
The
original
classification
of
sequence
variants
depended
on
changes
in
restriction
sites
see

This
was
followed
by
explicit

of

sheds
light
on
their
historical

and
on
the

characterizing

Contemporary
domestic
cattle
include
those
familiar
in
Western
Europe
and
North
America
Bos

and
the
zebu
of
Africa
and
India
Bos
indicus
The
most
obvious
difference
in
external
appearance
is
the
humped
back
of
the
zebu
It
has
been
widely
believed
that
the
domestication
of
cattle
occurred
once
about
800010
000
years
ago
and
that
the
two
species
subsequently
diverged
Analysis
of

European
African

cattle
suggest
however
that

all

The

in

Genetic

techniques
were
originally
based
on
patterns
of
VNTRs
but
have
been
extended
to
include
analysis
of
other
features
including
mitochondrial
DNA
sequences
For
most
of
us
all
our
mitochondria
are
genetically
identical
a
condition
called
homoplasmy
However
some
individuals
contain
mitochondria
with
different
DNA
sequences
called
heteroplasmy
Such
sequence
variation
in
a
disease
gene
can
complicate
the
observed
inheritance
pattern
of
the
disease
The
most
famous
case
of
heteroplasmy
involved
Tsar
Nicholas
II
of
Russia
After
the
revolution
in
1917
the
Tsar
and
his
family
were
taken
to
exile
in
Yekaterinburg
in
Central
Russia
During
the
night
of
1617
July
1918
the
Tsar
Tsarina
Alexandra
at
least
three
of
their
five
children
plus
their
physician
and
three
servants
who
had
accompanied
the
family
were
killed
and
their
bodies
buried
in
a
secret
grave
When
the
remains
were
rediscovered
assembly
of
the
bones
and
examination
of
the
dental
work
suggestedand
sequence
analysis
confirmedthat
the
remains
included
an
expected
family
group
The
identity
of
the
remains
of
the
Tsarina
were
proved
by
matching
the
mitochondrial
DNA
sequence
with
that
of
a
maternal
relative
Prince
Philip
Chancellor
of
the
University
of
Cambridge
Duke
of
Edinburgh
and
grandnephew
of
the
Tsarina
However
comparisons
of
mitochondrial
DNA
sequences
of
the
putative
remains
of
Nicholas
II
with
those
of
two
maternal
relatives
revealed
a
difference

the
Tsar

the

Extreme

even

showed
that

To
confirm
the

beyond

the

exhumed
and

Evolution
of
genomes
The
availability
of
complete
information
about
genomic
sequences
has
redirected
research
A
general
challenge
in
analysis
of
genomes
is
to
identify
interesting
events
A
background
mutation
rate
in
coding
sequences
is
reflected
in
synonymous
nucleotide
substitutions
changes
in
codons
that
do
not
alter
the
amino
acid
With
this
as
a
baseline
one
can
search
for
instances
in
which
there
are
significantly
higher
rates
of
nonsynonymous
nucleotide
substitutions
changes
in
codons
that
cause
mutations
in
the
corresponding
protein
Note
however
that
synonymous
changes
are
not
necessarily
selectively
neutral
Given
two
aligned
gene
sequences
we
can
calculate
K
s
the
number
of
synonyous
substitutions
and
K
a
or
the
number
of
nonsynonymous
substitutions
The
calculation
involves
more
than
simple
counting
because
of
the
need
to
estimate
and
correct
for
possible
multiple
changes
A
high
ratio
of
K
s
K
a
identifies
pairs
of
sequences
apparently
showing
positive
selection
possibly
even
functional
changes
The
new
field
of
comparative
genomics
treats
questions
that
can
only
now
be
addressed
such
as
What
genes
do
different
phyla
share
What
genes
are
unique
to
different
phyla
Do
the
arrangements
of
these
genes
in
the
genome
vary
from
phylum
to
phylum
What
homologous
proteins
do
different
phyla
share
What
proteins
are
unique
to
different
phyla
Does
the
integration
of
the
activities
of
these
proteins
vary
from
phylum
to
phylum
Do
the
mechanisms
of
control
of
expression
patterns
of
these
proteins
vary
from
phylum
to
phylum
What
biochemical
functions
do
different
phyla
share
What
biochemical
functions
are
unique
to
different
phyla
Does
the
integration
of
these
biochemical
functions
vary
from
phylum
to
phylum
If
two
phyla
share
a
function
and
the
protein
that
carries
out
this
function
in
one
phylum
has
a
homologue
in
the
other
does
the
homologous
protein
carry
out
the
same
function
The
same
questions
could
be
asked
about
different
species
in
each
phylum

Analysis
of
shared

among
all
domains
of
life
has
led
people
to
ask
whether
it
might
be
possible
to
define
a

that
is
an
organism
with
the

consistent
with
independent
life
based
on
the
central
DNA
RNA
protein
dogma
ie
excluding
proteinfree
life
forms
based
solely
on

The
minimal
organism
must
have
the
ability
to
reproduce
but
not
be
required
to
compete
in
growth
and
reproductive
rate
with
other
organisms
One
may
reasonably
assume
a
generous
nutrient
medium
relieving
the
organism
of
biosynthetic
responsibility
and
dispensing
with
stressreponse
functions
including
DNA

The
smallest
known
independent
organism
is
M
genitalium
with
468
predicted
protein
sequences
In
1996
AR
Mushegian
and
EV
Koonin
compared
the
genomes
of
M
genitalium
and
H
influenzae
At
the
time
these
were
the
only
completely
sequenced
bacterial

The
last

of
these
widely
diverged
bacteria
lived
about
2

years
ago
Of
1703
protein
coding
genes

are
homologues
of

M

Mushegian
and
129Koonin
reasoned
that
all
of
these
must
be
essential
but
might
not
be
sufficient
for
autonomous
life
for
some
essential
functions
might
be
carried
out
by
unrelated
proteins
in
the
two
organisms
For
instance
the
common
set
of
240
proteins
left
gaps
in
essential
pathways
which
could
be
filled
by
adding
22

Moreover
even

that

this

the

of

of

For
only
71
of
the
proposed
set
of
256
proteins
have
recognizable
homologues
among
eukaryotic
or

proteins
Nevertheless
identification
of

necessarily
common

allows

to

the

to
which
different

Genome
analysis
has
revealed
families
of
proteins
with
homologues
in
archaea
bacteria
and
eukarya
The
assumption
is
that
these
have
evolved
from
an
individual
ancestral
gene
through
a
series
of
speciation
and
duplication
events
although
some
may
be
the

of
horizontal

The
challenge
is
to
map
common
functions
and
common
proteins
Several
thousand
protein
families
have
been
identified
with
homologues
in
archaea
bacteria
and
eukarya
Different
species
contain
different
amounts
of
these

in

the

is
from
Aquifex

of

and
eukaryotic
homologues
to
Borrelia
burgdorferi
in
which
only
52
of
the

have
archaeal
and
eukaryotic
homologues
Archaeal
genomes
have
somewhat
higher
percentages
6271
of
proteins
with
bacterial
and
eukaryotic
homologues
But
only
35
of
the
proteins
of
yeast
have
bacterial
and
archaeal
homologues
Does
the

carry
out
the

Among
the

of
the
minimal

identified
from

only
30
have

Other

must
be

Brian
Hartley
commented
in
1970
that
the
bacterium
must
have
been
infected
by
a
cow
It
was
a
clear
case
of
lateral
or
horizontal
gene
transfer
a
bacterium
picking
up
a
gene
from
the
soil
in
which
it
was
growing
which
an
organism
of
another
species
had
deposited
there
The
classic
experiments
on
pneumococcal
transformation
by
O
Avery
C
MacLeod
and
M
McCarthy
that
identified
DNA
as
the
genetic
material
are
another
example
In
general
horizontal
gene
transfer
is
the
acquisition
of
genetic
material
by
one
organism
from
another
by
natural
rather
than
laboratory
procedures
through
some
means
other
than
descent
from
a
parent
during
replication
or
mating
Several
mechanisms
of
horizontal
gene
transfer
are
known
including
direct
uptake
as
in
the
pneumococcal
transformation
experiments
or
via
a
viral
carrier
Analysis
of
genome
sequences
has
shown
that
horizontal
gene
transfer
is
not
a
rare
event
but
has
affected
most
genes
in
microorganisms
It
requires
a
change
in
our
thinking
from
ordinary
clonal
or
parental
models
of
heredity
Evidence
for
horizontal
transfer
includes
1
discrepancies
among
evolutionary
trees
constructed
from
different
genes
and
2
direct
sequence
comparisons
between
genes
from
different
species
In
E
coli
755
ORFs
a
total
of
5478
kb
18
of
the
genome
appear
to
have
entered
the
genome
by
horizontal
transfer
after
divergence
from
the
Salmonella
lineage
100
million
years
ago
In
microbial
evolution
horizontal
gene
transfer
is
more
prevalent
among
operational
genesthose
responsible
for
housekeeping
activities
such
as
biosynthesisthan
among
informational
genes
or
those
responsible
for
organizational
activities
such
as
transcription
and
translation
For
example
Bradyrhizobium
japonicum
a
nitrogenfixing
bacterium
symbiotic
with
higher
plants
has
two
glutamine
synthetase
genes
One
is
similar
to
those
of
its
bacterial
relatives
and
the
other
is
50
identical
to
those
of
higher
plants

of
photosynthesis
has
been
passed
around
between
bacteria
mitochondria
and
algal
plastids
as
well
as
undergoing
gene
duplication
Many
phage
genes
appearing
in
the
E
coli
genome
provide
further
examples
and
point
to
a
mechanism
of
transfer
Nor
is
the
phenomenon
of
horizontal
gene
transfer
limited
to
prokaryotes
Both
eukarya
and
prokaryotes
are
chimaeras
Eukarya
derive
their
informational
genes
primarily
from
an
organism
related
to
Methanococcus
and
their
operational
genes
primarily
from
proteobacteria
with
some
contributions
from
cyanobacteria
and
methanogens
Almost
all
informational
genes
from
Methanococcus
itself
are
similar
to
those
in
yeast
Nor
is
gene
transfer
limited
to
ancient
ancestors
The
human
genome
has
revealed
hundreds
of
bacterial
proteins
among
our
genes
Conversely
at
least
eight
human
genes
appeared
in
the
M
tuberculosis
genome
131The
observations
hint
at
the
model
of
a
global
organism
a
genetic
common
market
or
even
a
worldwide
DNA
web
from
which
organisms
download
genes
at
will
How
can
this
be
reconciled
with
the
fact
that
the
discreteness
of
species
has
been
maintained
The
conventional
explanation
is
that
the
living
world
contains
ecological
niches
to
which
individual
species
are
adapted
It
is
the
discreteness
of
niches
that
explains
the
discreteness
of
species
But
this
explanation
depends
on
the
stability
of
normal
heredity
to
maintain
the
fitness
of
the
species
Why
would
not
the
global
organism
break
down
the
lines
of
demarcation
between
species
just
as
global
access
to
popular
culture
threatens
to
break
down
lines
of
demarcation
between
national
and
ethnic
cultural
heritages
Perhaps
the
answer
is
that
it
is
the
informational
genes
which
appear
to
be
less
subject
to
horizontal
transfer
that
determine
the
identity
of
the
species
It
is
interesting
that
although
evidence
for
the
importance
of
horizontal
gene
transfer
is
overwhelming
it
was
dismissed
for
a
long
time
as
rare
and
unimportant
The
source
of
the
intellectual
discomfort
is
clear
parenttochild
transmission
of
genes
is
at
the
heart
of
the
Darwinian
model
of
biological
evolution
whereby
selection
differential
reproduction
of
parental
phenotypes
alters
gene
frequencies
in
the
next
generation
For
offspring
to
gain
genes
from
somewhere
other
than
their
parents
smacks
of
Lamarck
and
other
discredited
alternatives
to
the
paradigm
The
evolutionary
tree
as
an
organizing
principle
of
biological
relationship
is
a
deeply
ingrained
concept
scientists
display
an
environmentalistlike
fervour
in
their
commitment
to
trees
even
when
trees
are
not
an
appropriate
model
of
a
network
of
relationships
See
Chapter
5
Perhaps
it
is
well
to
recall
that
Darwin
knew
nothing
of
genes
and
the
mechanism
that
generated
the
variation
on
which
selection
could
operate
was
a
mystery
to
him
Maybe
he
would
have
accepted
horizontal
gene
transfer
more
easily
than
his
followers
Comparative
genomics
of
eukarya
A
comparison
of
the
genomes
of
yeast
fly
worm
and
human
has
revealed
1308
groups
of
proteins
that
appear
in
all
four
genomes
These
form
a
conserved
core
of
proteins
for
basic
functions
including
metabolism
DNA
replication
and
repair
and
translation
These
proteins
are
made
up
of
individual
protein
domains
including
singledomain
proteins
oligomeric
proteins
and
modular
proteins
containing
many
domains
the
biggest
the
muscle
protein
titin
contains
250300
domains
The
proteins
of
the
worm
and
fly
are
built
from
a
structural
repertoire
containing
about
three
times
as
many
domains
as
the
proteins
of
yeast
Human
proteins
are
built
from
about
twice
as
many
as
those
of
the
worm
and
fly
Most
of
these
domains
appear
also
in
bacteria
and
archaea

some
are

only

a

To
create
new
proteins
inventing
new
domains
is
an
unusual
event
It
is
far
more
common
to
create
different
combinations
of
existing
domains
in
increasingly
complex
ways
A
common
132mechanism
is
by
accretion
of
domains
at
the
ends
of
modular
proteins
see

This
process
can

of
people
Clinical
consequences
include
haemolytic

The
gene
has
not
been
eliminated
from
the

The
scientific
literature
Scientific
publication
began
as
interpersonal
communication
Schoolsknown
as
far
back
as
Pythagorasand
lectures
seminars
and
discussions
all
involve
oral
communication
often
supplemented
by
demonstrations
see
box
about
Robert
Hooke
or
audiovisual
material
JR
Oppenheimer
once
said
The
best
way
to
send
information
is
to
wrap
it
up
in
a
person
Only
now
is
this
changing
computers
are
Robert
Hooke
at
The
Royal
Society
In
1662
Robert
Hooke
became
Curator
of
Experiments
at
the
newly
formed
Royal
Society
of
London
His
duties
included
a
demonstration
of
novel
experimental
results
every
week
at
the
Societys
regular
meetings
He
fulfilled
this
responsibility
for
41
years
Hooke
had
very
wideranging
interests
his
achievements
included
the
discovery
of
the
cell
in
April
1683
137becoming
ever
more
important
mediators
of
humantohuman
communication
Of
course
computer
tocomputer
communication
is
also
playing
an
essential
role
in
research
and
in
society
as
a
whole
Formal
written
articles
or
books
sometimes
based
on
transcriptions
of
talks
constitute
the
conventional
scientific
literature
Classically
scientists
presented
their
major
results
as
fulllength
books
Euclid
Copernicus
and
Newton
are
wellknown
examples
The
first
scientific
journal
the
Proceedings
of
the
Royal
Society
began
publication
in
1800
as
a
collection
of
abstracts
of
longer
publications
A
few
scientists
continued
to
present
their
results
as
books
notably
Darwins
On
the
Origin
of
Species
by
Means
of
Natural
Selection
and
Freuds
The
Interpretation
of
Dreams
However
monographs
and
articles
became
the
preferred
form
of
publication
of
scientific
results
Today
in
addition
to
journals
formats
of
scientific
publication
include
presentations
at
meetings
books
or
chapters
contributed
to
books
material
on
the
web
films
radio
or
television
programmes
and
podcasts
The
web
provides
an
alternative
to
paper
as
a
mechanism
of
distribution
of
the
regular
scientific
literature
It
has
created
novel
media
and
forms
of
publication
These
include
bulletin
boards
blogs
course
notes
presentations
from
scientific
meetings
or
courses
use
of
socialnetworking
routes
and
compendia
such
as
the
Wikipedia
Webbased
publications
uninhibited
by
peer
review
are
of
highly
variable
quality
In
addition
websites
are
volatile
Anyone
who
browses
will
encounter
many
pointers
to
vanished
links
Indeed
the
mean
lifetime
of
a
URL
is
3
months
So
the
mean
lifetime
of
a
website
is
comparable
to
the
mean
lifetime
of
a
human
erythrocyte
On
the
one
hand
we
lose
some
valuable
material
through
this
volatility
On
the
other
hand
many
sites
persist
long
after
they
cease
to
be
adequately
uptodate
Unlike
the
organic
world
the
web
has
no
efficient
mechanism
for
decay
and
turnover
of
dead
matter
A
specific
handicap
to
effective
use
of
the
web
for
research
is
the
lack
of
a
standard
indicator
of
when
any
site
was
last
modified
Google
searches
allow
restriction
of
results
to
recently
modified
sites
However
some
irrelevant
modifications
such
as
adding
an
advertisement
may
give
a
site
the
spurious
appearance
of
currency
Formal
academic
publications
must
pass
the
test
of
peer
review
This
is
an
imperfect
but
nevertheless
valuable
criterion
of
quality
Before
the
internet
the
scientific
literature
appeared
on
paper
primarily
in
the
form
of
journals
Today
journals
appear
electronically
as
well
as
on
paper
Many
scientists
with
adequate
internet
access
now
only
rarely
visit
a
library
to
read
journals
Indeed
the
major
reason
for
the
survival
of
paper
copies
at
all
is
the
need
of
publishers
and
subscribers
to
work
out
a
mutually
satisfactory
and
secure
economic
model
to
charge
for
access
see
section
Economic
factors
governing
access
to
scholarly
publications
The
emergence
of
digital
libraries
has
at
least
two
important
implications
1
the
delivery
of
the
literature
is
delocalized
changing
from
a
repository
of
paper
copies
at
one
or
more
fixed
sites
to
any
point
with
web
access
and
suitable
authorization
such
as
a
personal
or
institutional
password
2
computational
methods
of
information
retrieval
help
to
identify
relevant
articles
from
the
vast
amount
of
information
available
Searching
has
replaced
browsing
Does
this
bid
goodbye
to
serendipity
The
standard
retort
Why
should
you
have
to
buy
a
full
bottle
of
wine
if
all
you
want
is
a
glass
seems
to
me
to
miss
the
point
that
the
difference
between
searching
and
browsing
is
not
merely
one
of
quantity
but
of
variety
and
the
magic
of
the
unexpected
intellectual
connection
The
website
BananaSLUG
the
mascot
of
the
University
of
California
at
Santa
Cruz
throws
in
a
random
word
to
a
set
of
search
terms
with
the
goal
of
rounding
up
more
than
the
usual
suspects

httpwwwbananaslugcom
Readers
can
experiment
with
it
and
138draw
their
own
conclusions
about
its
effectiveness
One
could
of
course
do
this
by
hand
Economic
factors
governing
access
to
scholarly
publications
In
the
traditional
economic
model
of
scientific
journals
a
scientific
organization
or
a
commercial
publisher
produces
and
distributes
at
regular
intervals
a
paperbound
issue
containing
one
or
more
articles
Many
journals
include
ancillary
material
such
as
book
reviews
or
meeting
announcements
Costs

subsidies

a

journals
publish

Until
relatively
recently
demand
was
fairly
inelastic
Academic
libraries
accepted
the
responsibility
of
taking
virtually
all
reputable
journals
in
the
teaching
and
research
fields
of
their
faculty
Often
a
university
would
buy
several
copies
of
a
journal
for
a
central
library
and
one
or
more
specialized
departmental
libraries
No
longer
Large
increases
in
costs
have
broken
the
budgets
of
academic
libraries
leading
to
cutbacks
in
subscriptions
Several
trends
have
buffeted
the
system
as
follows
139
More
papers
are
being
published
As
a
result
many
existing
journals
are
publishing
more
pages
each
year
larger
issues
andor
higher
publication
frequency
This
is
one
of
the
factors
driving
up
costs
Some
journals
have
given
up
by
publishing
electronically
in
a
timely
fashion
and
allowing
a
long
backlog
to
build
up
before
the
printed
publication
appears
The
larger
volume
of
publications
puts
libraries
under
financial
pressure
to
pay
the
increased
costs
of
purchasing
greater
volumes
of
material
to
bind
it
and
to
provide
spacein
principle
in
perpetuityto
house
the
purchased
journals
and
make
them
available
Ultimately
the
material
will
require
conservation
and
repair
To
save
money
libraries
reduce
purchases
leading
to
lower
print
runs
and
higher
prices
per
copy
a
vicious
cycle
Electronic
facilities
reduce
the
costs
of
paper
printing
and
distribution
and
also
editorial
costs
For
instance
electronic
typesetting
and
desktop
publishing
programs
greatly
reduce
the
cost
of
including
equations
and
graphics
in
a
technical
article
Electronic
distribution
extends
the
potential
format
of
journal
articles
which
may
more
liberally
include
colour
movies
sound
clips
and
web
links
Nevertheless
for
libraries
journal
costs
even
for
journals
distributed
electronically
are
increasing
Mergers
of
publishing
companies
present
libraries
with
monolithic
suppliers
at
liberty
to
increase
fees
In
defence
libraries
are
joining
to
gain
collective
strength
OhioLINK

and

The
main
tension
between
readers
and
publishers
is
economic
However
scientists
depend
crucially
on
journals
in
another
purely
academic
respect
peer
review
Today
any
research
group
might
simply
post
their
results
on
the
web
What
the
journals
provide
through
the
review
process
is
a
putative
guarantee
of
trustworthiness
and
quality
in
the
articles
published
Despite
a
few
well
publicized
exceptions
and
many
more
unpublicized
ones
the
system
works
fairly
well
A
European
Commission
report
notes
that
Scientific
journals
fulfill
a
double
role
of
certification
and
dissemination
of
knowledge
1
The
peerreview
process
also
acts
as
an
again
putative
guarantee
and
ranking
of
the
quality
of
scientists
A
major
component
of
judging
and
comparing
scientists
for
career
milestones
of
hiring
and
promotion
depends
on
the
record
of
peerreviewed
publication
This
too
works
wellnot
without
exceptionsbut
it
is
a
very
expensive
solution
of
the
problem
and
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
logical
link
between
the
quality
of
a
scientists
achievements
and
the
medium
in
which
they
are
reported
A
cynic
has
quipped
The

or
Stanford

web
postings
90
of
scientific
journals

Open

Open
access
is
a
redefinition
of
the
authorpublisherreader
relationship
Open

retains
the
peerreview
process
as
the
criterion
for
publication
Then
Accepted
articles
are

Such
use
of
material
not
subject
to
open

would
require
consent
of
the
author

Open
access
has
wide
popular
appeal
in
the
scientific
community
Supporters
include
both
individual
scientists
in
their
dual
roles
of
producers
and
consumers
of
the
literature
and
funding
agencies
The
US
National
Institutes
of
Health
and
the
several
research
councils
and
the
Wellcome
Trust
in
the
UK
require
open
access
to
publications
reporting
work
that
they
have
supported
The
European
Commission
intends
to
institute
analogous
requirements
on
research
it
supports
and
urges
member
states
to
follow
its
lead
Several
universities
have
imposed
requirements
on
faculty
for
openaccess
publication
The
US
congress
considered
in
several
sessions
but
did
not
pass
the
Federal
Research
Public
Access
Act
Passage
and
presidential
approval
of
this
act
would
go
beyond
the
National
Institutes
of
Health
guidelines
by
requiring
public
availability
via
the

of
all
journal

resulting
from
work

The
Public
Library
of
Science
The
Public
Library
of
Science
was
started
in
October
2000
by
HE
Varmus
PO
Brown
and
MB
Eisen
to
put
the
principles
of
open
access
into
practice
It
is
a
nonprofit
organization
of
professional
scientists
not
commercial
publishers
Its
goals
include
to
make
available
public
access
to
the
scientific
literature
to
organize
the
scientific
literature
so
that
it
is
computersearchable
to
encourage
developments
of
innovative
approaches
to
information
retrieval
from
the
scientific
literature
With
funding
from
the
Gordon
and
Betty
Moore
Foundation
and
other
sources
the
Public
Library
of
Science
has
launched
a
series
of
journals
which
will
permit
exploration
of
different
relationships
including
but
not
limited
to
economic
onesbetween
authors
publishers
and
readers

141Traditional
and
digital
libraries
On
most
university
campuses
a
large
fortresslike
building
occupies
a
prominent
and
central
site
Functions
of
the
traditional
library
include
archiving
cataloguing
and
curating
printed
material
providing
to
readers
facilities
for
convenient
access
to
the
literature
helping
readers
find
what
they
need
This
involves
help
in
both
identification
of
suitable
sources
of
information
and
gaining
access
to
them
organizing
the
reservation
borrowing
and
return
and
photocopying
of
material
To
enforce
security
primarily
against
loss
theft
or
damage
Regular
surveillance
for
misshelved
books
is
essential
a
misshelved
book
is
worse
than
a
stolen
one
because
it
continues
to
occupy
space
somewhere
providing
a
place
to
read
study
meet
and
communicate
to
interact
with
other
libraries
to
enhance
user
services
for
instance
organizing
interlibrary
loans
providing
facilities
for
disabled
readers
for
instance
scanning
andor
audio
transcription
of
books
and
articles
for
the
blind
to
speak
up
for
readers
rights
For
instance
the
American
Library
Association
organized
opposition
to
the
loss
of
readers
rights
to
privacy
imposed
by
the
US
Patriot
Act
of
2001
Of
course
librarians
also
mediate
between
readers
and
publishers
in
areas
such
as
open
access
and
in
negotiating
subscription
prices
In
a
digital
library
in
contrast
the
archives
are
in
electronic
form
not
on
paper
provision
of
access
is
at
a
computer
screen
rather
than
off
a
shelf
This
detaches
the
point
of
access
from
the
point
of
repository
The
archives
can
be
anywhere
The
access
point
can
be
anywhere
Many
cities
on
all
continents
except
Antarctica
have
established
a
complete
saturation
of
wireless
access
over
their
entire
areas
even
librarian
assistance
to
readers
can
be
done
by
email
or
Skype
or
their
equivalents
not
requiring
a
person
stationed
at
the
access
point
security
concerns
more
typically
take
the
form
of
password
control
rather
than
protection
against
physical
theft
or
damage
Damage
to
a
library
computer
is
damage
to
library
facilities
not
to
library
contents
the
digital
analogue
of
the
place
to
study
meet
and
communicate
is
perhaps
the
computer
caf
which
may
well
be
within
the
library
Some
libraries
offer
computerequipped
conference
rooms
Or
perhaps
collaborative
study
meeting
and
communication
will
all
be
entirely
online
Physical
proximity
may
be
unnecessary
for
intellectual
intercourse
representing
readers
interests
and
developing
enhanced
user
services
including
assistive
technology
for
the
disabled
remain
responsibilities
and
commitments
The
detachment
of
archive
and
access
points
raises
the
question
of
whether
the
central
library
building
is
necessary
At
urban
universities
in
particular
the
footprint
of
the
building
occludes
a
large
chunk
of
prime
real
estate
Why
not
go
out
in
the
country
somewheremany
miles
away
if
necessarydig
a
big
hole
install
computer
equipment
and
connectionskeeping
at
most
a
skeleton
staffand
establish
highspeed
electronic
links
to
the
user
community
Then
replace
the
central
142library
with
a
sports
and
recreation
facility
The
most
important
loss
in
such
a
scenario
is
the
provision
of
quiet
distractionfree
rooms
in
which
to
concentrate
Some
people
can
find
such
a
place
in
a
home
or
office
Many
people
cant
and
some
of
them
realize
what
they
are
missing
How
to
populate
a
digital
library
Many
publishers
distribute
material
in
electronic
form
Although
there
are
no
real
technical
obstacles
many
economic
questions
involving
the
renegotiation
of
traditional
financial
relationships
among
authors
publishers
subscribers
and
readers
remain
unsolved
Older
publications
that
exist
only
on
paper
can
be
scanned
in
and
redistributed
electronically
Scanning
initially
produces
a
page
image
readable
by
a
human
but
not
easily
intelligible
to
a
computer
At
this
stage
it
is
not
easy
to
search
the
material
Optical
character
recognition
can
convert
the
page
images
to
searchable
form
at
least
as
far
as
the
text
is
concerned
An
obstacle
to
creating
largescale
digital
libraries
by
scanning
is
the
restriction
imposed
by
copyright
In
the
UK
copyright
law
began
in
1709
during
the
reign
of
Queen
Anne
shortly
after
the
unification
of
England
and
Scotland
which
prompted
legal
reconciliations
of
certain
aspects
of
the
disparate
systems
Under
current
UK
law
printed
material
remains
under
copyright
for
70
years
from
the
end
of
the
calendar
year
of
the
death
of
the
last
surviving
author
See
Weblem
33
Legal
impediments
notwithstanding
the
Google
Books
Library
project
has
organized
the
largescale
scanning
of
material
from
approximately
two
dozen
academic
libraries
including
those
of
Harvard
Princeton
and
Stanford
Universities
the
Universities
of
Michigan
and
California
and
the
New
York
Public
Library
in
the
USA
and
the
Oxford
University
Library
in
the
UK
Different
libraries
have
adopted
different
stances
with
respect
to
material
remaining
in
copyright
For
instance
the
agreement
between
Google
and
Princeton
envisages
digitizing
only
material
in
the
public
domain
a
selection
of
about
1
million
books
out
of
a
total
university
collection
of
6
million
printed
works
and
5
million
manuscripts
In
contrast
the
agreement
between
Google
and
the
University
of
Michigan
Library
involves
comprehensive
scanning
but
limited
release
of
the
product
All
results
will
be
searchable
However
in
the
case
of
material
restricted
by
copyright
only
a
small
amount
of
material
will
be
accessible
amounting
to
a
few
sentences
around
the
search
term

an
example

The
information
explosion
Recalling
The
Sorcerers
Apprentice
efficient
delivery
can
be
a
mixed
blessing
The
growth
in
number
of
practising
scientists
has
led
to
an
increase
in
the
quantity
of
publications
by
expansion
of
existing
journals
and
proliferation
of
new
ones
The
literature
has
passed
a
threshold
beyond
which
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
to
read
all
the
literature
in
any
given
field
PubMed
lists
over
a
million
articles
with
a
2012
publication
date
Assuming
an
average
length
of
10
pages
a
backofthe
envelope
calculation
suggests
that
during
2012
the
scientific
literature
grew
by
over
1000
pages
per
hour
Assuming
it
takes
30
minutes
to
read
a
paper
it
would
take
2
months
to
read
all
the
papers
published
in
a
single
day
It
is
extremely
difficult
to
command
comprehensive
knowledge
of
even
a
relatively
narrow
specialty
Outside
ones
own
particular
field
it
is
impossible
This
has
stimulated
the
growth
of
143secondary
journals
aimed
at
nonspecialists
containing
reviews
or
tutorial
presentations
These
journals
have
titles
such
as
Reviews
of
Trends
in
or
Current
Opinion
in
etc
Of
course
in
addition
to
these
formal
publications
the
web
contains
many
other
sources
of
information
of
which
Wikipedia
is
the
best
known
More
specialized
versions
also
exist
for
instance
Proteopedia
for
proteins
organized
by
E
Hodis
E
Martz
JL
Sussman
J
Prilusky
and
D
Canner
httpwwwproteopediaorg
In
addition
to
standalone
articles
the
site
includes
molecular
graphics
links
to
journal
articles
in
its
Interactive
3D
Complements
in
Proteopedia
Complements
being
a
general
term
not
referring
to
any
component
of
the
immune
system
The
conclusion
is
that
a
reader
must
be
selective
Search
engines
play
an
essential
role
in
helping
to
pick
out
journal
articles
and
other
information
sources
on
the
basis
of
combinations
of
keywords
that
match
a
specific
topic
From
one
relevant
publication
links
to
related
articles
can
identify
others
Specialized
blogs
help
also
But
even
the
most
reasonable
procedures
threaten
to
produce
reading
lists
with
more
material
than
one
can
assimilate
except
with
the
narrowest
possible
focus
The
web
higher
dimensions
The
web
does
more
than
provide
a
convenient
channel
for
distribution
of
information
Hypertext
by
supporting
links
among
different
sites
changes
fundamentally
the
dimensionality
of
our
access
to
information
The
presentation
of
material
in
a
typical
traditional
book
or
article
is
linear
you
are
intended
to
read
successive
lines
on
successive
pages
Footnotes
are
an
exception
In
some
cases
footnotes
contain
lengthy
commentary
on
or
extension
of
the
main
textBritish
historian
Edward
Gibbon
was
famous
for
thisbut
often
they
are
merely
citations
And
most
people
tend
to
skip
sections
of
technical
detail
at
least
on
a
first
reading
Hypertext
makes
a
difference
Websites
contain
embedded
links
Internal
links
take
you
to
other
portions
of
the
text
of
a
current
document
or
to
associated
images
movies
or
sounds
External
links
take
you
in
the
first
instance
to
sites
containing
related
or
supplementary
information
Following
links
from
those
sites
will
take
you
everywhere
without
limit
Even
the
traditional
scientific
literature
formed
a
network
of
interrelated
ideas
and
data
Hypertext
facilitates
fluid
navigation
of
this
network
A
few
readers
may
remember
days
in
which
one
read
a
journal
in
the
library
of
a
biology
department
found
a
reference
to
a
journal
located
in
the
chemistry
department
library
crossed
campus
to
read
the
cited
article
found
there
a
reference
to
an
article
in
the
mathematics
library
New
media
video
sound
The
internet
allows
the
extension
of
media
of
presentation
from
the
traditional
text
with
interspersed
pictures
to
incorporation
of
material
in
many
other
formats
Extensive
sets
of
coloured
pictures
movies
or
audio
are
in
many
cases
the
best
way
to
present
scientific
results
For
instance
it
is
very
difficult
to
capture
the
important
details
of
a
complex
macromolecular
structure
as
a
still
picture
a
movie
affords
a
much
better
perception
of
three
dimensions
This
is
the
motivation
for
the
Interactive
3D
Complements
component
of
Proteopedia
The
intrinsic
importance
of
sound
in
some
fieldsmusicology
for
exampleis
obvious
In
biology
the
study
of
songs
of
birds
and
of
whales
are
equally
obviously
based
on
sounds
But
there
are
applications
in
biomedicine
also
the
University
of
Pennsylvania
Medical
School
has
distributed
sound
clips
of
healthy
and
abnormal
cardiac
activity
as
mp3
files
that
physicians
in
training
can
144download
onto
portable
audio
players
The
internet
even
enhances
the
distribution
of
text
For
example
the
author
of
a
computer
program
can
make
it
available
for
downloading
If
the
program
were
lengthy
publishing
it
on
paper
only
would
be
extremely
inconvenient
and
require
the
user
to
retype
it
Searching
the
literature
The
component
of
the
scientific
literature
that
is
available
in
electronic
form
constitutes
a
database
To
search
this
database
is
to
specify
a
set
of
criteria
in
the
form
of
combinations
of
keywords
The
result
of
the
search
will
be
a
list
of
documents
that
match
the
specifications
A
followup
question
is
a
subsequent
related
search
with
modification
of
the
criteria
For
example
if
a
search
returned
a
large
number
of
articles
published
over
the
course
of
many
years
one
might
wish
to
search
again
limiting
the
results
to
articles
published
during
the
past
2
years
For
readers
interested
in
the
biomedical
literature
the
standard
access
route
is
the
specialized
database
PubMed
from
the
US
National
Library
of
Medicine
PubMed
is
the
bibliographic
component
of
the
composite
database
ENTREZ
maintained
by
the
US
National
Center
for
Biotechnological
Information
NCBI
Most
searching
over
the
web
is
text
searching
However
pattern
matching
of
pictorial
information
has
been
very
important
in
interpretation
of
aerial
and
satellite
pictures
for
battlefield
reconnaissance
for
forecasting
of
agricultural
yields
in
detecting
rare
events
in
photographs
of
particle
collisions
and
in
analysing
shoppers
habits
in
supermarkets
In
molecular
biology
karyotyping
a
photomicrograph
of
chromosomes
is
a
pictorial
patternrecognition
problem
General
search
engines
such
as
Google
are
very
powerful
and
will
return
lists
of
websites
including
but
not
limited
to
articles
in
the
scientific
literature
These
are
the
most
comprehensive
results
Google
Scholar
is
a
specialized
offshoot
of
the
general
Google
search
engine
that
covers
academic
publications
primarily
books
and
journal
articles
Its
advantages
include
simplicity
of
use
access
to
material
in
commercial
journals
not
generally
publicly
available
and
the
facility
to
list
publications
that
cite
a
selected
one
Between
the
backward
references
cited
in
the
paper
and
the
forward
references
in
which
the
paper
is
cited
any
particular
work
takes
its
place
as
a
node
in
a
network
of
publications
about
its
subject

Staying
on
top
of
a
subject
Suppose
you
have
used
search
engines
literature
databases
etc
to
gain
a
rounded
appreciation
of
the
state
of
knowledge
about
some
topic
How
can
you
effectively
assimilate
continuing
developments
One
way
would
be
to
revisit
the
same
general
sources
and
sort
out
recent
additions
from
the
ones
you
have
seen
before
A
more
efficient
approach
is
to
ask
the
sources
to
take
the
initiative
of
informing
you
of
new
information
called
push
rather
than
pull
This
takes
the
form
of
current
awareness
features
in
search
engines
and
databases
For
instance
many
publishers
will
alert
you
to
publications
that
cite
selected
articles
Or
you
can
specify
a
protein
sequence
and
receive
alerts
of
new
sequences
related
to
your
standing
orders
by
similarity
of
either
sequence
or
keywords
More
generally
you
can
145specify
general
search
parameters
and
receive
updated
results
of
an
automatic
periodic
repetition
of
the
search
see
for
example

An
inconvenience
of
many
alerting
agents
is
that
they
inform
you
by
email
An
alternative
is
any
of
a
number
of
systems
called
RSS
which
stands
for
Really
Simple
Syndication
These
require
that
1
the
sites
from
which
you
want
to
receive
alerts
broadcast
updates
of
their
information
on
the
web
and
2
you
run
a
program
called
an
aggregator
that
collects
information
from
the
feeds
filters
it
according
to
some
keyword
specification
and
displays
what
remains
in
a
window
on
your
screen
More
recently
social
networking
facilities
have
been
applied
to
create
specialized
blogs
dealing
with
particular
scientific
topics
Organizing
and
sharing
the
harvest
What
is
the
electronic
analogue
of
a
stack
of
reprints
cluttering
up
your
desk
You
can
download
selected
articles
and
save
them
in
a
directory
Browsers
allow
saving
lists
of
bookmarks
or
favourites
These
lists
have
the
disadvantages
of
1
often
containing
only
short
cryptic
information
and
2
residing
locally
on

an

Many
people
have
a

computer
in
their

and
use
a

To
solve
this

several
programs
allow
you
to

independent
An
early
example
was
the
program
Connotea
httpwwwconnoteaorg
developed
by
the
Nature
Publishing
Group
Connotea
stored
URLs
with
keywords
or
tags
to
serve
as
mnemonics
if
necessary
if
the
URL
corresponded
to
an
article
in
the
scientific
literature
the
reference
would
automatically
be
associated
with
the
entry
A
comments
field
allowed
more
extended
annotation
Connotea
has
discontinued
its
activity
having
been
superseded
by
general
social
network
sites
and
sites
specialized
for
scientist
such
as
ReadCube
CiteULike
and

In
addition
to
organizing
any
individuals
sites
of

the
results
gathered
in
accounts
on
these

can
be
shared
Colleagues
with
overlapping

can
browse

Several
individuals
contributing
to
the
comments
field
can
create
a
blog
about
any

Teachers
can
prepare

The
scientific
commentary
and
interpersonal
aspects
of
sharing
annotated
URL
lists
may
well
be
more
popular
than
the
purely
bibliographic
ones
An
academic
department
will
typically
host
a
site
combining
a
schedule
of
seminar
speakers
and
retreats
plus
intramural
sports
schedules
retreats
and
depending
on
location
plans
for
picnics
betriebsausflge
etc
The
site
httpsdelicious
emphasizes
the
social
aspects
of
sharing
URL
annotations
An
example
of
a
list
primarily
intended
for
other
people
to
read
would
be
an
online
bridal
registry
with
shared
writeaccess
to
allow
flagging
of
items
as
purchased
Other
types
of
primarily
social
information
sharing
include
dating
and
personal
genealogy
sites
Now
it
is
known
that
a
component
of
attractiveness

pheromones
linked
to
MHC

Perhaps
inclusion
of
personal
MHC
sequences
in
the
information
available
to
a
dating
site
might
improve
its
effectiveness
The
146distinction
between
scientific

is
tenuous
indeed
Databases
A
database
is
an
organized
collection
of
information
in
computerreadable
form
Defining
characteristics
of
databases
include
the
contents
the
ontology
the
list
of
valid
terms
and
their
definitions
the
logical
structure
or
the
expression
the
interrelationships
among
the
data
called
the
schema
the
format
of
the
data
the
routes
for
selective
retrieval
of
data
and
for
presentation
of
the
results
and
passing
them
on
to
a
program
for
analysis
links
to
other
information
resources
other
databases
references
to
original
publication
of
data
tutorial
background
etc
Any
database
project
must
assemble
all
of
these
In
addition
many
independent
avenues
of
retrieval
are
possible
anyone
can
write
his
or
her
own
front
end
to
any
distributed
or
webaccessible
database
Usually
but
not
always
only
the
institution
that
maintains
the
archives
takes
responsibility
for
curation
and
annotation
of
the
data
Database
contents
Most
databases
limit
themselves
to
a
circumscribed
subject
Of
course
different
databases
have
horizons
of
different
breadths
But
most
have
a
unifying
theme
For
example
the
International
Nucleotide
Sequence
Database
Collaboration
a
partnership
of
the
European
Nucleotide
Archive
at
the
EBI
Hinxton
UK
GenBank

USA
and
the
DNA
Data
Bank
of
Japan
at
the
National
Institute
of
Genetics
Mishima
Japan
comprehensively
collects
curates
and
annotates
nucleotide
sequences
including
genome
and
metagenome
sequences
FlyBase
is
a
database
containing
Drosophila
genes
and
genomes
plus
material
of
interest
to
the
community
of
scientists
carrying
out
research
on
D

FlyBase
includes
a
bulletin
board
showing
schedules
of

an
atlas
of

and

The
International
Nucleotide

from
different
points
of

within
different

Macromolecular

It
is
tempting
to
regard
certain
databases
as
primary
those
that
originally
gather
the
data
and
are
147responsible
for
curation
that
is
applying
quality
control
standardizing
format
and
providing
annotation
and
archiving
Staff
at
primary
databases
have
expertise
in
the
experimental
techniques
that
produced
the
data
Secondary
databases
or
derived
databases
then
take
data
from
the
primary
databases
recombine
them
reannotate
and
reformat
them
represent
them
and
provide
different
informational
environments
different
facilities
and
different
links
However
the
distinction
between
primary
and
secondary
databases
is
not
as
clear
cut
as
it
used
to
be
The
literature
as
a
database
Medline
Medical
Literature
Analysis
and
Retrieval
System
Online
is
the
bibliographic
database
of
the
US
National
Library
of
Medicine
Medline
has
been
integrated
into
PubMed
the
bibliographical
component
of
the
NCBI
database
ENTREZ
Medline
covers
the
scientific
literature
of
fields
related
to
research
teaching
and
delivery
of
healthcare
It
includes
relevant
areas
of
fundamental
science
Medline
is
not
primarily
patient
oriented
MedlinePlus
is
a
lesstechnical
information
resource
about
healthcare
For
instance
a
search
in
MedlinePlus
for
allopurinol
a
drug
used
in
treating
gout
and
related
diseases
returns
a
page
linking
to
descriptions
of
the
diseases
for
which
this
drug
can
be
used
recommendations
for
dosage
side

etc
A
search
for
allopurinol
in
MedLine
via

returns
8000
technical
articles
most
of
which
do
not
deal
directly
with
the
prescription
of

in
current
clinical
practice
In

Database
organization
The
internal
structure
of
a
database
must
reflect
the
interrelationships
of
the
contents
in
a
way
that
facilitates
answering
queries
Types
of
database
organization
in
common
use
include
the
following
In
a
hierarchical
structure
items
are
classified
and
clustered
at
multiple
levels
The
original
Linnaean
taxonomy
and
its
many
descendants
including
the
Tree
of
Life
httpwwwtolweborgtree
are
examples
The
databases
SCOP
and
CATH
present
hierarchies
of
protein
structures
based
on
evolutionary
relationships
and
structural
similarity
We
shall
see
that
the
markup
language
XML
provides
a
natural
format
for
databases
of
information
with
natural
hierarchical
structures
In
a
famous
1970
paper
EF
Codd
of
the
IBM
Corporation
introduced
the
relational
database
The
basic
unit
of
a
relational
database
is
a
set
of
correspondences
between
different
features
of
the
database
contents
called
tables
Codd
showed
how
settheoretic
operations
union
intersection
difference
Cartesian
product
on
tables
facilitate
processing
of
logically
complex
queries
Mature
software
is
available
both
open
source
and
commercial
for
managing
relational
databases
and
for
processing
queries
A
relational
database
of
amino
acids
might
have
one
table
that
associates
with
each
amino
acid
its
name
its
three
and
oneletter
codes
its
volume
its
accessible
surface
area
and
the
chemical
nature
of
the
distal
atoms
in
its
sidechain
see
Box
31
This
organization
makes
it
easy
to
answer
queries
of
the
form
what
are
the
threeletter
codes
of
all
amino
acids
the
sidechains
of
which
have
distal
carboxyl
groups
The
operation
required
is
to
select
from
the
first
table
all
rows
in
which
the
Distal
group
has
the
value
carboxyl
and
to
report
the

it

to
extract

showing
the

of
all
amino

with
distal
methyl
groups
This
is
called
a

A
compound
query
might
take
the
form
what
are
the
threeletter
codes
of
all
amino
acids
that
have
volumes
greater
than
120
2
with
distal
carboxyl
or

A
second
table
might
associate
with
each
distal
atom
grouping
the
hydrogenbonding
potential
The
common
columnthe

queries
that
reflect

of
these

for
instance
what
are
the
threeletter
codes
of
all
amino
acids
the
sidechains
of
which
can
serve
as
hydrogenbond
donors
To
combine
the
information
in
both
tables
would
involve
in
Codds
terms
a
join
of
the
two
tables
The
general
join
operation
amounts
to
forming
the
Cartesian
product
of
the
two
tables
The
149Cartesian
product
of
two
sets
is
the
set
of
ordered
pairs
of
elements
one
from
each
set
If
the
sets
contain
n
and
m
elements
the
Cartesian
product
will
contain
nm
elements
There
are
20
entries
in
the
first
table
and
13
in
the
second
The
Cartesian
product
would
contain
260
rows
combining
information
from
the
first
table
appearing
at
the
left
and
from
the
second
table
appearing
on
the
right
Here
are
just
a
few
illustrative
lines
parts
of
a
join
from
a
relational
database
of
properties
of
amino
acids
To
report
the
threeletter
codes
of
amino
acids
that
have
sidechains
that
could
serve
as
hydrogen
bond
acceptors
we
want
to
do
what
is
called
a
natural
join
This
retains
from
the
combined
tables
those
rows
in
which
columns
6
and
7
are
equal
Of
the
three
rows
shown
containing
alanine
one
contains
methyl
in
both
columns
6
and
7
Of
the
rows
shown
containing
aspartic
acid
one
contains
carboxyl
in
columns
in
both
columns
6
and
7
The
others
would
be
rejected
The
survivors
form
a
new
table
containing
columns
specifying
the
hydrogenbonding
potential
associated
with
each
amino
acid
We
could
then
select
from
this
combined
table
the
rows
containing
hydrogenbond
acceptors
and
report
their
threeletter
codes
One
such
row
would
appear
as
follows
after
merging
the
two
equal
Distal
group
columns
following
the
natural

From
this

we
could
extract

The
relational
database
organization
lends
itself
naturally
to
processing
complex
queries
constructed
as
logical
compositions
of
simpler
queries

are
the

The
Structured

is
a
fairly
wellstandardized

Annotation
A
typical
entry
in
a
database
in
molecular
biology
might
contain
the
sequence
of
a
gene
However
the
entry
will
contain
more
than
the
bare
nucleotide
sequence
It
will
also
contain
reference
information
citations
of
the
publications
that
served
as
the
source
of
the
entry
the
history
of
the
entry
in
the
database
and
accession
information
assigned
by
the
database
interpretative
information
for
example
the
limits
of
exons
within
the
sequence
links
to
other
information
perhaps
a
protein
sequence
database
containing
information
about
product
encoded
and
the
function
attributed
to
that
product
or
other
entries
in
the
same
or
other
databases
describing
homologous
genes
When
databases
were
more
thematically
focused
and
isolated
there
was
a
comfortable
and
clear
distinction
between
the
primary
data
and
the
annotations
Annotations
tended
to
be
freeform
comments
some
expressed
more
casually
than
others
Recently
many
database
mergers
have
occurred
in
response
to
the
need
to
assemble
a
wide
spectrum
of
information
about
gene
sequences
and
many
other
items
As
a
result
of
mergers
and
of
the
importance
of
ontologies
and
computer
interpretable
formats
entries
in
databases
have
taken
more
formal
structures
It
is
growing
more
difficult
to
draw
as
sharp
a
distinction
between
data
and
annotation
Some
of
the
information
in
entries
is
more
reliable
than
others
Nucleic
acid
sequences
determined
by
modern
techniques
with
generous
coverage
allowing
confident
assembly
are
quite
accurate
On
the
other
hand
assignment
of
function
to
gene
products
in
the
absence
of
direct
experimental
information
is
an
important
challenge
in
database
annotation
It
is
a
common
practice
to
transfer
functional
annotation
from
a
previously
annotated
homologous
protein
This
approach
relies
on
the
assumptions
that
1
because
homologous
proteins
have
similar
sequences
and
structures
they
also
have
similar
functions
and
2
the
annotation
of
the
homologue
is
correct
Often
but
certainly
not
always
these
assumptions
are
valid
However
because
of
the
phenomenon
of
recruitment
proteins
very
similar
or
even
identical
in
sequence
can
adopt
different
functions
See
Chapter
8
This
can
lead
to
misannotation
Database
quality
control
If
errors
do
enter
databasesin
either
data
or
annotationsthey
tend
to
propagate
into
other
databases
and
are
very
difficult
to
extirpate
In
principle
there
are
two
approaches
to
improving
database
quality
keeping
errors
out
in
the
first
place
and
removing
them
when
they
have
been
detected
As
part
of
the
getitrightfirsttime
approach
database
curation
and
annotation
has
emerged
as
a
new
profession
Curators
bring
to
their
activities
a
specialized
panoply
of
skills
and
attitudes
The
quality
of
their
work
translates
directly
into
the
quality
of
the
databases
Nevertheless
the
high
volume
and
diversity
of
subjects
of
scientific
papers
makes
it
difficult
for
database
staff
to
keep
up
adequately
with
the
workload
An
alternative
approach
is
to
involve
the
scientists
who
publish
papers
in
the
harvesting
of
database
entries
based
on
their
results
For
example
the
Protein
Data
Bank
accepts
from
authors
a
virtually
complete
entry
including
annotations
corresponding
to
the
structure
deposited
Databank
staff
carry
out
validation
procedures
151but
rarely
add
significant
amounts
of
material
However
despite
the
professionalism
of
the
curators
and
the
assiduity
of
their
checking
errors
will
appear
The
first
problem
is
to
identify
them
and
the
second
is
to
remove
them
One
approach
to
identifying
errors
is
to
enlist
experts
as
external
curators
to
examine
database
entries
in
their
own
specialties
Often
database
users
call
attention
to
errors
Given
how
virtually
all
work
in
the
biomedical
field
depends
on
databases
it
is
clear
that
quality
of
data
directly
affects
the
quality
of
research
The
dynamic
quality
of
databases
creates
additional
problems
the
proliferation
of
divergent
copies
of
an
object
that
is
continually
changing
anyway
makes
it
difficult
to
reproduce
published
investigations
Once
identified
errors
can
be
corrected
in
a
master
copy
of
a
database
particularly
if
the
database
management
is
in
the
hands
of
a
single
institution
or
a
closecoupled
partnership
However
correction
at
source
is
not
enough
because
1
Many
users
create
local
versions
of
databases
These
copies
will
contain
the
errors
that
appeared
at
the
time
of
downloading
The
dissemination
of
any
corrections
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
frequency
of
updating
of
the
downloaded
versions
2
Many
other
databases
assimilate
reintegrate
and
redisseminate
data
processes
which
may
shield
errors
from
correction
especially
if
items
are
not
carefully
tagged
with
their
site
and
date
of
origin
One
attractive
idea
is
to
create
knowbots
robot
programs
that
sweep
the
web
checking
for
errors
Knowbots
are
a
delocalized
form
of
UNIX
daemons
However
security
issues
would
block
them
from
most
sites
What
is
possible
are
programs
that
offer
health
checks
of
versions
of
databases
Two
examples
are
The
PDBREPORT
database

contains
the
results
of

software
WHATCHECK
applied
to
each
entry
in
the
Protein
Data
Bank
The
program
tests
the
validity
and
consistency
of
the
format
and
also
analyses
the
structures
detecting
outliers

Scientists
in
the

world
who
determine
novel
data
such
as
gene
sequences
or
protein
structures
are
expected
to
deposit
the

in

To
do
this
is
at
least
potentially
to
sacrifice
commercial
rights
or
the
intellectual
advantages
of
unshared
knowledge
in
a
competitive
field
of
research
The
commercial
sector
of
research
in
molecular
biologyprominently
including
but
not

to
the
pharmaceutical
and
biotechnology
industriesgenerally
regards

generate
Even
in
the
academic
world
this
is
not
a
new
conflict
Early
in
the
eighteenth
century
Isaac
Newton
demanded
access
to
data
collected
by
the
Astronomer
Royal
John
Flamsteed
to
prepare
a
new
edition
of
his
Principia
Flamsteed
refused
claiming
ownership
of
the

despite
its
having
been
collected
while
he
occupied
an
official
government
post
Today
journals
and
granting

require
deposition
of

Journals
will
not
accept
papers
without
confirmation
of
deposition
from
an
appropriate

Although
these
rules
now
have
general
acceptance
their
establishment
was
controversial
Science
made
an
exception
to
its

policy
in

A
similar

applied
to
the

of

eliciting

Conversely
Science

of

Some
databases
but
not
all
permit
users
to
extract
entry
data
in
bulk
For
this
to
be
worthwhile
the
data
must
be
in
a
generally
accessible
format
To
this
end
some
databases
maintain
a
version
in
which
each
entry
appears
as
plain
text
called
a
flat
file
This
is
not
necessarily
the
most
useful
internal
format
but
facilitates
general
data
exchange
Other
collections
are
maintained
using
widely
available
databasemanagement
systems
These
are
easily
distributable
among
installations
running
equivalent
software
The
Relational
Database
format
is
an
example
All
databases
must
carefully
impose
controls
on
permission
to
modify
their
contents
Databases
in
molecular
biology
are
generally
maintained
by
specific
institutions
or
by
limited
partnerships
External
users
can
submit
information
and
suggest
corrections
or
other
changes
but
not
modify
the
database
directly
To
the
extent
that
external
specialists
may
be
invited
to
curate
data
about
particular
topics
the
databases
will
have
to
consider
mechanisms
of
extending
modification
rights
to
these
external
curators
154Links
The
utility
of
a
database
depends
on
the
quality
of
its
links
as
well
as
on
its
contents
Internal
links
allow
navigation
around
the
database
itself
External
links
make
connection
to
other
databases
including
literature
databases

Database
interoperability
How
can
we
deal
with
questions
that
require
appeal
to
multiple
databases
at
once
There
are
two
general
approaches
1
merge
several
databases
into
a
single
one
with
the
combined
contents
of
the
contributors
2
develop
methods
for
intercommunication
between
databases
that
allow
dissection
and
distribution
of
queries
and
recombination
of
responses
Historically
there
were
good
reasons
why
databases
maintained
a
pretty
sharp
focus
on
a
selected
topic
Database
projects
reflected
the
interests
and
expertise
of
small
groups
of
dedicated
individuals
The
data
representation
and
organization
flowed
from
the
natural
properties
of
the
information
Moreover
in
the
early
days
levels
of
support
remained
relatively
small
With
no
earmarked
categories
of
funding
databases
had
to
compete
withand
often
were
obliged
to
disguise
not
really
too
strong
a
word
themselves
asresearch
projects
This
was
another
factor
promoting
specialization
The
overall
growth
and
consolidation
of
effort
in
recent
years
of
genome
sequencing
and
associated
bioinformatics
and
database
activities
has
given
a
natural
impetus
to
merging
of
157information
resources
Some
for
instance
UniProtKB
have
assimilated
a
number
of
separate
databases
into
the
universal
protein
resource
as
they
describe
themselves
ENTREZ
maintained
at
the
NCBI
in
the
USA
closecouples
36
component
databases
with
facilities
for
simultaneous
searching
Of
course
the
common
managerial
superstructure
facilitates
the
integration
of
these
databases
One
obvious
component
of
integration
is
consistency
checking
and
reconciling
of
disagreements
in
data
or
annotation
The
alternative
approach
is
to
leave
individual
databases
separate
and
to
layer
a
query
system
on
top
of
them
This
system
would
1
disassemble
information
retrieval
requests
into
partial
questions
that
would
be
farmed
out
to
different
databases
and
then
2
merge
the
responses
into
a
coherent
conclusion
This
is
an
active
area
of
current
research
Most
people
would
not
consider
it
a
solved
problem
Common
to
all
approaches
is
the
goal
of
facile
interaction
among
different
databases
This
involves
both
a
careful
specification
of
the
ontology
and
schema
of
each
database
so
that
the
outside
world
can
correctly
interpret
its
contents
and
create
mechanisms
for
handling
queries
within
a
framework
free
of
commitment
to
any
specific
database
organization

which

Data
mining
The
examples
we
have
discussed
of
information
retrieval
from
databases
have
involved
the
framing
by
a
user
of
a
specific
set
of
criteria
and
the
return
of
relevant
entries
selected
according
to
criteria
Consider
alternatively
a
scientific
field
in
the
exploratory
phase
where
a
large
amount
of
data
has
become
available
and
the
challenge
is
to
understand
what
underlying
patterns
exist
The
first
step
is
to
generate
hypotheses
about
those
patterns
Perhaps
experts
might
guess
what
to
look
for
Testing
and
refining
the
experts
hypotheses
then
requires
computer
programs
that
probe
information
archives
with
sets
of
queries
seeking
relationships
and
correlations
in
the
data
This
is
the
traditional
way
that
science
has
made
progress
Now
the
power
of
programs
permits
them
to
take
the
initiative
in
data
exploration
to
some
extent
For
example
programs
can
be
adapted
to
assign
data
to
classes
on
the
basis
of
training
with
examples
even
if
it
is
not
possible
explicitly
to
specify
the
rules
that
define
the
classes
It
is
even
possible
for
a
program
to
suggest
hypotheses
about
patterns
implicit
in
our
data
This
amounts
to
a
partial
automation
of
scientific
research
Machine
learning
is
a
computational
approach
to
data
analysis
in
which
through
analysis
of
relevant
information
resources
computer

achieve
the
ability
to
infer
properties
of

Two
complementary
aspects
are
1
knowledge
discovery
descriptions
or
even
explanations
of
regularities
in
the
data
and
2
successful
forecasting
or
predictive
modelling
Sophisticated

Support

in
a
number
of
applications
Both
artificial
neural
networks
and
support
vector
machines
are
data
structures
and
algorithms
for
supervised
learning
In
supervised
learning
the
general
framework
of
a
program
is
constructed
but
the
details
depend
on
choices
of
parameters
By
exposing
the
program
to
a
number
of
objects
of
known
classification
and
telling
the
program
whether
its
prediction
was
correct
or
not
the
supervision
phase
the
program
can
tune
its
parameters
to
give
the
optimal
performance
The
computer
programs
that
implement
some
machinelearning
techniques
including
artificial
neural
networks
have
complex
internal
structures
Large
numbers
of
variable
parameters
give
them
versatility
optimization
of
the
parameters
by
training
can
achieve
impressive
accuracy
in
classifying
input
data
A
disappointing
aspect
is
that
it
is
usually
impossible
to
pick
apart
a
trained
network
to
harvest
any
insights
into
the
structure
of
the
data
that
are
expressible
in
a
simple
understandable
form
R
Hamming
wrote
The
goal
of
computing
is
insight
not
numbers
Today
most
people
want
both
Some
statistical
methods
do
provide
such
insight
at
least
by
identifying
which
are
the
important
variables
or
combinations
of
variables

Odours
are
an
important
component
of
our
perceptual
environment
and
play
crucial
roles
in
the
sensory
lives
of
many
mammals
From
the
molecular
point
of
view
a
set
of
receptor
protein
molecules
mediates
recognition
and
distinction
of
odours
Typically
mammals
express
1000
homologous
odorantreceptor
proteins
At
the
psychological
level
humans
can
distinguish
10

odours
However
it
is
difficult
to
classify
odours
There
is
no
natural

metric
that
would
allow
us
to
say
of
the
odours
of

Moreover
judgements
of

have
a
component
that
varies
with

and
may
be
influenced
by

or

To

The

is
the
most
obvious
way
to
create
a

Applied
to
this

the

reduced

160Programming
languages
differ
from
natural
human
languages
in
many
respects
including
a
restricted
horizon
of
possibility
of
expression
and
very
strict
intolerance
to
error
A
similar
intolerance
to
error
affects
the
preparation
and
formatting
of
data
to
be
read
by
computer
programs
To
serve
as
input
to
a
program
data
must
be

presented
according
to
specific
rulesfor

terms
restricted
to
a
controlled
vocabularyand
2
properly
formatted
There
is
a
tension
between
userfriendliness
and
programfriendliness
in
the
requirements
Another
distinction
which
is
not
as
sharp
as
it
used
to
be
classifies
programs
into
systems
programs
and
applications
programs
Applications
programs
are
generally
specific
to
one
or
more
users
They
solve
a
particular
problem
in
a
particular
field
They
are
active
in
a
computer
for
limited
times
after
which
they
report
an
answer
and
disappear
In
contrast
systems
programs
govern
the
overall
workflow
of
the
computer
are
common
to
all
users
and
are
consistent
with
the
use
of
the
computer
to
solve
a
wide
variety
of
problems
by
means
of
individual
applications
programs
For
instance
a
program
to
superpose
two
or
more
protein
structures
would
be
an
application
program
The
programs
that
create
the
general
operating
environmentfor
instance
UNIX
or
Microsoft
Windowsare
systems
programs
Operating
systems
offer
many
specific
facilities
in
addition
to
their
overall
housekeeping
functions
To
create
lists
of
orders
invoking
the
facilities
of
the
operating
system
is
to
write
a
program
called
a
script
The
boundaries
between
systems
and
applications
program
are
becoming
fluid
All
the
features
of
the
editor
with
which
I
am
typing
this
paragraph
are
specific
to
the
problem
of
accepting
and
editing
text
However
many
people
use
it
it
was
distributed
with
the
operating
system
and
it
remains
active
in
background
even
when
I
am
finished
with
this
passage
Conversely
many
programmers
who
put
together
large
and
powerful
packages
that
address
a
variety
of
problemsfor
example
retrieval
of
genetic
sequences
from
a
databaseboast
of
having
written
program
systems
rather
than
systems
programs
Traditional
programming
languages
Previous
generations
of
computer
languages
included
FORTRAN
C
and
C
Usually
a
separate
program
called
the
compiler
translates
a
program
in
these
languages
into
the
appropriate
set
of
computer
instructions
The
maturity
of
compiler
technology
together
with
the
understanding
of
algorithms
provided
by
computer
scientists
and
the
experience
and
skill
of
the
community
of
programmers
combine
to
make
these
languages
most
suitable
for
largescale
computations
which
strain
the
available
resources
Another
advantage
of
not
writing
in
native
machine
language
is
code
portability
the
ability
of
one
program
written
in
FORTRAN
C
or
C
to
run
on
a
large
variety
of
platforms
It
is
true
that
each
target
machine
language
requires
its
own
compiler
But
writing
a
compiler
needs
be
done
only
once
per
machine
and
there
is
mature
software
that
facilitates
compiler
construction
Then
an
entire
literature
of
programs
becomes
executable
Scripting
languages
Many
extremely
useful
tasks
require
only
minimal
computer
resources
For
instance
the
translation
of
a
gene
sequence
into
an
amino
acid
sequence
requires
only
a
straightforward
lookingup
on
a
table
for
each
codon
See
Chapter
1
For
these
a
simple
program
achieves
adequate
throughput
what
is
important
is
to
save
programmer
time
The
computer
time
required
is
often
negligible
161Indeed
there
has
been
a
steady
trend
in
the
relative
costs
of
hardware
and
software
The
balance
is
tipping
steeply
in
the
direction
of
high
costs
of
creating
software
relative
to
purchasing
and
maintaining
hardware
Programming
practice
has
reacted
with
tools
and
languages
that
streamline
the
effort
required
to
write
code
that
works
correctly
even
at
some
cost
in
efficiency
of
execution
Several
languages
provide
such
facilities
including
PERL
PYTHON
and
RUBY
At
least
in
their
initial
versions
they
were
interpreted
languages
This
means
that
the
systems
program
that
carried
out
the
commands
skipped
the
step
of
compilation
to
machine
language
but
simulated
the
stated
operation
on
a
linebyline
basis
In
principle
this
makes
for
lessefficient
execution
In
any
case
it
is
a
legitimate
price
to
pay
for
the
ease
of
writing
the
program
and
the
sharp
curtailment
of
the
debugging
phase
Often
the
difference
in
execution
time
is
unnoticeable
Some
languages
can
be
run
in
either
interpretive
or
compiled
mode
for
instance
LISP
Demonstration
by
a
new
interpreted
language
such
as
PERL
of
significant
advantages
and
popular
appeal
will
elicit
writing
of
a
compiler
or
at
least
a
more
efficient
interpreter
A
superficially
attractive
but
ultimately
ineffective
idea
is
to
write
a
translation
program
that
will
convert
the
scripting
language
into
a
language
which
can
be
compiled
This
will
often
not
speed
up
execution
significantly
if
the
original
interpreter
calls
upon
programs
written
in
the
compiled
language
Useful
skills
in
using
a
scripting
language
such
as
PERL
are
relatively
easy
to
attain
relative
to
languages
such
as
C
or
C
Learning
some
PERL
or
PYTHON
or
RUBY
is
a
good
compromise
for
a
research
scientist
who
does
not
intend
to
specialize
in
software
creation
Program
libraries
specialized
for
molecular
biology
Programmers
usually
construct
new
programs
by
combining
wellestablished
components
For
instance
an
algorithm
may
contain
a
step
that
requires
sorting
a
list
or
solving
linear
equations
Subprograms
for
these
steps
are
widely
available
All
programs
depend
on
standard
libraries
for
input
and
output
Almost
never
does
one
write
a
program
completely
from
scratch
In
addition
to
standard
libraries
for
numerical
analysis
and
text
processing
there
are
libraries
specialized
for
molecular
biology
Different
libraries
are
associated
with
different
programming
languages
For
example
BioPERL
httpwwwbioperlorg
contains
modules
that
implement
common
computational
tasks
in
bioinformatics
written
in
PERL
Typical
modules
translate
nucleic
acid
sequences
to
protein
sequences
or
perform
sequence
alignments
Modules
can
be
integrated
smoothly
into
a
new
program
Java
computing
over
the
web
The
Java
language
has
a
syntax
with
many
similarities
to
C
and
C
Its
operating
environment
is
designed
to
address
the
following
problem
suppose
the
creator
of
a
website
wants
to
provide
a
program
which
users
can
run
interactively
from
a
browser
If
the
program
is
run
on
a
computer
at
the
website
and
if
many
users
simultaneously
avail
themselves
of
the
facilities
the
hardware
on
which
the
website
is
running
will
come
under
pressure
An
example
of
this
mode
is
the
NCBI
BLAST
server
which
in
a
typical
month
fields
about
65
million
enquiries
and
runs
them
on
a
cluster
with
300
CPUs
An
alternative
is
to
ask
each
user
to
provide
the
computer
power
Without
leaving
the
website
the
browser
will
dynamically
download
programs
called
applets
The
programs
will
be
run
on
the
users
computer
This
in
turn
creates
a
security
problem
the
user
must
give
the
website
access
to
resources
on
the
users
computer
A
website
that
can
download
executable
code
and
gain
access
to
162the
local
files
can
do
considerable
harm
including
crashing
the
computer
or
snooping
around
the
file
system
to
steal
or
damage
confidential
information
or
carrying
out
unwanted
invasive
activity
such
as
displaying
unsolicited
advertising
material
The
basic
idea
of
the
way
to
protect
the
user
is
as
follows
the
downloaded
Java
program
is
not
run
directly
by
the
users
operating
system
but
involves
an
intermediate
agent
The
users
system
simulates
an
internal
computercalled
a
virtual
machinewhich
runs
the
Java
program
Each
actual
operating
system
requires
its
own
Java
virtual
machine
to
provide
the
executable
environment
for
programs
written
in
Java
Automatic
portability
of
Java
programs
is
concomitant
The
virtual
machine
carefully
restricts
the
resources
to
which
the
Java
program
running
under
its
auspices
has
access
The
local
virtual
machine
imposes
the
rules
the
distant
website
programmer
must
follow
them
Java
is
a
compiled
language
Although
usually
executed
from
a
browser
Java
programs
can
stand
alone
In
contrast
programs
in
JavaScript
are
interpreted
by
a
browser
Markup
languages
Algorithms
data
structures
programs
N
Wirth
Markup
languages
implement
data
structures
which
are
as
essential
a
component
of
programs
as
executable
instructions
Data
structures
are
the
organization
of
the
information
on
which
a
program
acts
Choice
of
the
proper
data
structure
is
a
crucial
aspect
of
programming
The
term
markup
originally
described
editors
annotations
to
manuscripts
which
control
the
appearance
of
the
final
published
text
without
explicitly
appearing
in
it
An
example
would
be
designation
of
certain
words
to
appear
in
italics
Computertypesetting
systems
include
formatting
commands
the
UNIX
facilities
of
the
roff
family
are
an
early
example
and
D
Knuths
TeX
system
is
a
development
with
all
possible
bells
and
whistles
HTML
or
hypertext
markup
language
is
primarily
a
presentational
markup
language
The
utility
of
the
close
coupling
of
annotation
with
contents
extends
beyond
presentation
markup
to
organization
of
data
in
files
Such
a
structure
provides
an
alternative
to
traditional
positional
formatting
Positional
formatting
is
specifying
how
to
interpret
an
item
in
a
file
through
rigid
rules
specifying
where
the
item
appears
Typical
examples
of
positional
formatting
are
The
number
of
bases
in
the
sequence
appears
in
columns
1016
or
Items
separated
by
white
space
appear
in
the
order
gene
name
source
organism
number
of
bases
sequence
The
markup
approach
achieves
greater
flexibility
by
associating
each
item
with
a
local
descriptor
The
line
could
appear
anywhere
in
a
file
A
program
or
a
human
reader
would
recognize
what
the
number
5386
signified
The
syntax
descriptor
value
descriptor
is
common
to
many
markup
languages
including
HTML
The
descriptor
is
called
a
tag
The
material
enclosed
by
the
beginning
and
end
of
the
tag
is
called
the
element
Standardization
of
the
syntax
simplifies
the
construction
of
the
software
to
interpret
it
Tagelement
combinations
provide
selfdescribing
data
Moreover
the
data
description
is
local
that
is
contiguous
with
individual
data
items
In
contrast
the
summaries
that
appear
in
the
Learning
goals
at
the
beginning
of
each
chapter
in
this
book
are
descriptions
of
contents
that
are
not
local
to
the
sections
to
which
they
refer
163Flexibility
of
format
comes
at
a
price
most
obviously
in
a
rather
cumbersome
and
bloated
appearance
of
the
files
Nor
is
adult
supervision
entirely
unnecessary
the
ontology
of
the
data
must
specify
acceptable
ranges
of
values
Programs
could
not
be
asked
to
swallow
Therefore
any
file
in
a
markup
language
requires
a
schema
a
list
of
allowed
element
and
attribute
names
and
allowed
ranges
of
values
This
permits
validating
a
file
for
proper
formatting
and
consistency
A
Document
Type
Definition
itself
written
in
a
standardized
language
specifies
the
schema
Note
that
number
of
bases
Tuesday
number
of
bases
is
valid
syntax
but
invalid
with
respect
to
any
reasonable
schema
There
are
many
markup
languages
specialized
for
different
types
of
data
One
of
the
most
general
is
XML
or
extensible
markup
language
used
in
many
databases
and
informationretrieval
systems
XML
assumes
a
treebased
or
hierarchical
structure
of
the
material
Lowerlevel
tags
and
elements
can
appear
within
higherlevel
ones
An
XML
database
of
mammalian
species
might
contain
the
following
Note
the
three
nested
levels
of
tags
mammals
genus
species
The
species
elements
include
the
common
name
as
an
attribute
In
an
alternative
schema
the
common
name
might
be
a
separate
tag
within
the
species
It
would
be
more
difficult
to
construct
an
XML
database
of
information
that
is
nonhierarchical
Consider
a
database
of
information
about
movies
It
would
be
possible
to
define
an
XML
schema
in
which
the
movie
title
was
at
a
higher
level
in
the
hierarchy
than
the
list
of
performers
Then
it
would
be
easy
to
probe
the
database
with
a
movie
title
and
retrieve
the
cast
In
contrast
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
retrieve
all
the
movies
in
which
Peter
Sellers
acted
In
an
alternative
schema
the
performers
could
be
at
a
higher
level
than
the
movies
making
it
easy
to
search
for
an
actor
or
actress
but
then
it
would
be
difficult
to
probe
with
a
title
and
retrieve
the
cast
A
relational
database
would
be
a
more
natural
way
to
organize
the
data
if
one
wanted
to
be
able
to
query
with
either
movie
title
or
performer
However
facilities
for
such
queries
are
not
completely
incompatibile
with
XML
Even
in
a
database
that
is
structured
hierarchically
with
an
XML
schema
it
is
possible
to
index
it
in
different
ways
to
support
versatile
approaches
to
retrieval
including
nonhierarchical
ones
XML
unlike
HTML
is
not
directly
concerned
with
appearance
or
presentation
On
the
other
hand
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
write
formatting
programs
that
control
the
presentation
of
the
contents
of
an
XML
file
such
as
the
mammalgenusspecies
example
Such
a
program
could
follow
convention
to
display
genus
and
species
names
in
italics
Different
programs
could
impose
independent
decisions
about
how
to
display
common
names
One
program
could
display
common
names
in
boldface
another
in
plain
roman
type
In
contrast
in
an
HTML
file
the
decision
to
display
common
names
in
boldface
type
would
be
irrevocably
implemented
by
tags
b
neanderthal
man
b
which
would
force
neanderthal
man
to
appear
in
boldface
Moreover
it
is
impossible
to
make
up
novel
tags
for
HTML
format
without
approval
by
an
international
commission
In
other
words
the
schema
of
HTML
has
been
fixed
This
164has
the
advantage
of
complete
portability
and
the
disadvantage
of
inflexibility
Markup
languages
in
general
and
XML
and
HTML
in
particular
are
becoming
standard
in
database
construction
and
distribution
Archiving
and
curating

XML
provides
a
general
and
flexible
structure
compatible
with
organizing

from
many
different
fields
and
applications
Data

of

The

interoperability
Providing
data
to
programs
Insertion
of
a

between
an
XML

and

can
simplify
the

of

Ease
of
data
extraction
and

Selection
of
data
and
formatting
into
an
HTML
file
can
be
a
natural
and
fluent
mapping
that
facilitates
conversion
of
data
into
a
form
that
is
both
human
friendly
and
distributable
over
the
web
Other
markup
languages
provide
facilities
for
describing
graphics
These
are
profoundly
concerned
with
both
data
structure
and

Natural

Biomedical
research
depends
crucially
on
the
quality
of
the
data
and
annotations
in
databases
Some
annotations
are
generated
from
the
data
whereas
others
are
extracted
from
articles
in
the
scientific
literature
Extraction
from
the
literature
is
a
labourintensive
activity
that
will
not
be
able
to
keep
up
with
the
increasing
rate
of
published
articles
Will
it
be
possible
for
computers
to
take
over
this
task
Unlike
most
input
prepared
for
computers
in
strictly
defined
formats
the
literature
aimed
primarily
at
humantohuman
communication
appears
in
a
natural

Natural

refers
to
the

Natural

processing
by

means
at

the

written
words
that
a
human
could
interpret
and
at

a

A
major
difficulty
in

is
the
ambiguity
of
words

If

his

does
he

from
such

by

to
resolve
ambiguities

Natural

Natural

in
bioinformatics
has
set
as
goals
the
extraction
of
information
from
the
relevant
scientific
literature
and
databases
Applications
of

of
databases
of

include
the
following
Identifying

and
combinations
of
keywords
Given
a
list
of

of

and
a

of

of

it
should
be
possible
to
identify
papers
that
contain
references
to

of
genes
and
diseases
and
to
produce
a
list
of
genedisease
combinations
based
on
cooccurrences
in
one
or
more
papers
Several
aspects
of
this
problem
make
it
more
challenging
than
a
simple
keyword
search
Many
biological
entities
have
multiple
synonyms
Conversely
many
terms
appear
in
several
technical
categories
and
are
used
also
as
colloquial
terms
As
an
extreme
example
consider
common
cold
cold

cold

proteinprotein

There
are
several
approaches
to
compiling
a
database
of
proteinprotein
interactions
some
experimental
and
some
theoretical
One
is
to
extract
information
automatically
from
the
scientific
literature
For
instance
an
article
entitled
Calnuc
binds
to
Alzheimers
amyloid
precursor
protein
and
affects
its
biogenesis
appeared
in
the
Journal
of
Neurochemistry
6
Of
course
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
sentence
is
in
the
title
or
the
text
of
the
article
A
human
reader
could
harvest
for
a
protein
interaction
database
the
pair
calnuc
and
Alzheimers
amyloid
precursor
protein
To
extract
this
information
automatically
it
would
help
to
have
a
list
of
protein
names
The
challenge
is
to
write
a
program
that
can
identify
within
processed
text
patterns
of
the
form
The
allows
for
various
kinds
of
intervening
material
For
instance
another
article
has
the
title
Ubiquitin
binds
to

regulates
a
subset
of
SH3
domains
7
The
program
should
recognize
the
verb
binds
and
ignore
to
and
regulates
Alternatively
if
one
were
trying
to
deduce
regulatory
networks
then
a
different
verb
would
form
part
of
the
pattern
With
respect
to
the
proteins
that
bind
ubiquitin
the
title
of
this
paper
is
relatively
general
A

SH3

would
if
properly
parsed
permit
extraction
of
three
specific
SH3

that
bind

One
word
within
the
that
the
pattern
should
not
ignore
is

The
sentence

the

for

but

It
is

Computational
analysis
of
texts
of
articles
in
the
biomedical
literature
offers
a
series
of
challenges
The
results
have
been
successful
in
supporting
the
identification
of
relevant
information
for
collection
into
databases
and
even
in
generating
useful
suggestions
for
treatments
of
diseases
One
goal
is
to
identify
papers
that
contain
targetted
types
of
information
For
example
the
protein
sequence
database
SWISSPROT
stores
information
about
protein
function
and
protein
post
translational
modifications
BIND
is
a
database
of
proteinprotein
interactions
Identification
of
papers
containing
relevant
information
supports
the
work
of
the
curators
of
these
databases
Because
the
set
of
terms
that
might
be
relevant
is
so
diffuse
simple
keyword
searches
do
not
suffice
For
instance
to
identify
posttranslational
modifications
a
search
for
PHOSPHORYLATION
would
pick
up
not
only
papers
describing
the
phosphorylation
of
proteinswhich
are
relevantbut
also
the
phosphorylation
of
glucose
or
fructose
which
might
well
not
be
168Selection
of
papers
is
already
a
useful
result
even
if
a
human
curator
must
read
them
The
next
step
would
be
automatic
extraction
of
the
information
from
the
paper
This
is
a
challenge
and
focus
of
current
research
CASPlike
evaluations
track
progress
The
most
basic
task
in
computer
analysis
of
an
article
is
to
identify
the
names
that
appear
names
of
genes
proteins
metabolites
drugs
and
diseases
or
more
generally
phenotypes
Name
identification
depends
heavily
on
dictionaries
but
natural
language
processing
contributes
semantic
information
helpful
in
both
recognizing
names
themselves
and
recognizing
modifiers
of
names
The
next
level
is
to
identify
associations
and
interactions
Examples
include
attempts
to
correlate
genes
or
proteins
with
diseases
or
more
generally
to
assign
function
to
genes
or
proteins
To
extract
interactions
the
minimal
pattern
must
include
two
names
one
interaction
the
interaction
being
specified
by
a
word
or
a
phrase
We
have
already
seen
examples
of
the
combination
There
are
many
other
proteinprotein
interactions
such
as
More
complex
combinations
are
very
important
a
correlation
between
a
set
of
interacting
proteins
and
two
or
more
apparently
unrelated
diseases
can
show
a
hidden
relationship
in
the
mechanism
underlying
the
diseases
Identification
of
references
to
individual
genes
and
proteins
A
basic
task
is
to
identify
in
a
body
of
text
the
names
of
the
relevant
objects
such
as
genes
and
proteins
The
difficulty
is
the
wide
range
and
ambiguity
of
names
and
the
use
of
common
words
as
parts
of
gene
names
The
problem
of
identifying
the
species
from
which
a
gene
arises
is
very
difficult
as
many
genes
have
equivalent
names
in
different
mammalian
species
It
is
very
important
to
recognize
species
differences
in
searching
for
correlations
between
genes
and
drug
activities
Tamoxifen
used
widely
against
breast
cancer
was
originally
developed
as
a
birthcontrol
pill
It
is
a
fine
contraceptive
for
rats
but
promotes
ovulation
in
women
Chang
Schtze
and
Altman
developed
a
program
called
GAPSCORE
that
identifies
gene
and
protein
names
within
submitted
text
10
One
might
think
that
simply
creating
a
dictionary
and
looking
for
its
entries
would
suffice
Dictionaries
are
of
course
at
the
core
of
any
identification
procedure
But
many
genes
names
have
other
meanings
For
instance
ring
which
stands
for
really
interesting
new
gene
can
also
appear
in
articles
in
the
biomedical
literature
in
the
context
of
chemical
structure
histidine
ring
or
histology
signetring
cell
Even
the
common
colloquial
sense
of
the
word
ring
as
an
item
of
jewellery
appears
in
the
scientific
literature
in
connection
with
metalelicited
contact
dermatitis
Also
a
dictionary
should
include
a
thesaurus
specifying
for
example
that
PTEN
and
MMAC1
are
synonyms
PTEN
stands
for
phosphatase
and
tensin
homolog
and
MMAC1
stands
for

Xeroderma
pigmentosum
and
Cockayne
syndrome
two
diseases
of
DNA
repair
Xeroderma
pigmentosum
is
a
genetic
disorder
involving
a
defect
in
the
ability
to
repair
damage
caused
by
ultraviolet
light
This
leads
most
obviously
to
great
sensitivity
to
sunlight
including
tendency
upon
even
short
exposure
to
sunburn
blisters
and
freckles
More
devastating
is
the
predisposition
to
development
of
malignant
tumours
presumably
arising
from
unrepaired
damage
to
tumoursuppressor
genes
Cockayne
syndrome
shares
with
xeroderma
pigmentosum
a
sensitivity
to
sunlight
but
involves
other
symptoms
including
abnormal
growth
and
development
leading
to
short
stature
retinal
and
other
neurological
degeneration
and
premature
aging
Risk
of
skin
cancer
is
normal
not
elevated
as
in
xeroderma
pigmentosum
A
small
number
of
cases
of
the
xeroderma

are

In
this
respect
the

produce
the
combined
symptomsthe
XPCS
complexmay
be
the
ones
that
provide
the
clues
Hypothesis
generation
The
literature
implicitly
contains
many
unsuspected
relationships
DR
Swanson
read
papers
that
connected
magnesium
and
epilepsy
and
papers
that
connected
epilepsy
and
migraine
headaches
Taken
together
these
suggested
to
him
that
there
should
be
a
relationship
between
magnesium
and
migrane
Subsequent
research
confirmed
such
a
link
Swanson
had
other
successes
including
the
suggestion
that
fish
oil
would
benefit
patients
with
Raynauds
syndrome
a
disorder
affecting
blood
vessels
of
the
extremities
Subsequent
research
confirmed
this
suggestion
as
well
Automation
of
Swansons
approach
is
an
obvious
goal
implementation
of
effective
methods
is
not
so
easy
P
Srinivasan
and
B
Libbus
developed
software
to
apply
Swansons
approach
They
searched
for
applications
of
turmeric
a
spice
from
the
rhizomes
of
the
plant
Curcuma
longa
containing
the
active
compound
curcumin
13
In
Asia
turmeric
is
in
common
use
in
cooking
Its
medicinal
properties
are
also
well
known
It
is
an
analgesic
and
an
antiseptic
used
for
treatment
of
burns
stomach
ulcers
skin
diseases
and
the
common
cold
172A
PubMed
search
for
TURMERIC
OR
CURCUMIN
OR
CURCUMA
returned
1175
documents
From
these
using
natural
language
processing
Srinivasan
and
Libbus
extracted
terms
with
names
of
genes
or
genomes
enzymes
and
amino
acids
peptides
or
proteins
and
ranked
these
terms
by
how
frequently
they
turned
up
in
the
articles
identified
They
then
reprobed
PubMed
using
these
results
as
search
terms
and
extracted
from
the
results
and
ranked
terms
referring
to
diseases
or
syndromes
neoplastic
processes
terms
referring
to
cancer
The
idea
is
that
this
procedure
would
link
turmeric
with
certain
diseases
through
the
medium
of
genes
genomes
enzymes
or
proteins
see
Fig
37
The
results
embody
suggestions
that
turmeric
would
have
some
relation
with
the
diseases
and
perhaps
even
be
useful
in
their
treatment
Figure
37
The
goal
is
to
link
a
probe
term
such
as
turmeric
with
a
set
of
diseases
In
a
twostage
procedure
first
probe
PubMed
with
the
probe
term
and
recover
names
of
genes
genomes
enzymes
and
proteins
These
links
from
turmeric
to
molecules
have
a
strength
proportional
to
the
number
of
times
the
term
appears
in
the
articles
that
PubMed
identifies
as
related
to
turmeric
A
second
stage
probes
PubMed
again
separately
with
each
of
the
molecules
identified
in
the
first
stage
This
time
analysis
of
the
articles
extracts
names
of
diseases
Again
the
ranking
of
the
moleculedisease
link
is
proportional
to
the
number
of
times
the
disease
term
appears
in
the
articles
that
PubMed
identified
in
the
second
stage
A
connection
between
turmeric
and
a
disease
through
two
strong
links
is
suggestive
of
a
relationship
between
turmeric
and
the
disease
Srinivasan
and
Libbus
discussed
three
diseases
retinal
diseases
including
diabetic
retinopathy
inflammation
and
glaucoma
Crohn
disease
disorders
related
to
the
spinal
core
including
inflammation
following
injury
and
an
autoimmune
disease
resembling
multiple
sclerosis
A
common
feature
of
all
these
diseases
is
inflammation
A
common
set
of
proteins
linking
turmeric
with
the
disease
includes
TNF
MAPK
NFB
COX2
and
other
cytokines
and
interleukins
Knowing
the
molecules
involved
in
the
links
between
turmeric
and
diseases
means
that
scientists
can
understand
the
mechanism
by
which
turmeric
might
be
expected
to
act
The
result
is
not
merely
a
correlation
but
supports
a
rationale
of
the
relevance
of
the
turmeric
to
the
disease
which
in
turn
usefully
guides
design
of
experiments
to
evaluate
and
elucidate
the
connection
and
the
clinical
utility
of
the
probe
substance

Knowing
how
to

and
how
to
launch
analyses
of

This
chapter
introduces
the
specialized
informationretrieval
skills
that
will
allow
you
to
make
effective
use
of
the
data
banks
in
molecular
biology
The
goal
is
to
give
you
familiarity
with
basic
operations
It
will
then
be
easy
to
improve
and
develop
your
technique
and
to
learn
in
more
detail
the
facilities
and
interrelationships
and
interactions
of
resources
available
on
the
web
Convenient
sources
of
training
materials
include
the
tutorials
embedded
in
many
data
banks
An
example
is
the
ENTREZ
tutorial
site
at
the
US
National
Center
for
Biotechnology
Information
NCBI
httpwwwncbinlmnihgoveducationtutorials
The
European
Bioinformatics
Institute
EBI
offers
many
tutorials
on
various
aspects
of
experiments
databases
and
bioinformatics
Database
indexing
and
specification
of
search
terms
An
index
is
a
set
of
pointers
to
information
in
a
database
You
have
explored
the
entire
worldwide
web
with
a
general
search
engine
such
as
Google
and
have
visited
specialized
databases
in
molecular
biology
You
proposed
one
or
more
search
terms
and
the
retrieval
program
checked
for
them
in
its
tables
of
indices
The
model
is
that
the
database
is
composed
of
entries
discrete
coherent
parcels
of
information
The
software
identified
entries
with
contents
relevant
to
your
interest
An
example
of
the
simplest
paradigm
is
that
you
submit
the
term
horse
and
the
program
returns
a
list
of
entries
that
contain
the
term
horse
A
full
search
of
the
web
would
turn
up
information
about
many
different
aspects
of
horses
molecular
biology
breeding
racing
poems
about
horsesmost
of
which
you
do
not
want
to
see
For
a
successful
search
it
is
not
enough
to
mention
what
you
do
want
you
must
specialize
your
search
to
ensure
that
your
desired
responses
dont
get
buried
in
a
mass
of
extraneous
rubbish
Of
course
rubbish
is
merely
whatever
other
people
are
interested
in
To
focus
the
results
informationretrieval
programs
accept
multiple
query
terms
or
keywords
A
search
for
horse
liver
alcohol
dehydrogenase
would
produce
responses
specialized
to
this
enzyme
The
search
would
most
likely
identify
entries
that
contain
all
four
keywords
that
you
submitted
177horse
AND
liver
AND
alcohol
AND
dehydrogenase
Poems
about
horses
would
be
unlikely
to
appear
among
its
top
hits
It
is
possible
to
ask
for
other
logical
combinations
of
indexing
terms
For
instance
if
a
search
engine
did
not
know
about
transatlantic
spelling
differences
it
would
be
useful
to
be
able
to
search
for
hemoglobin
OR
haemoglobin
Note
that
a
search
for
hemoglobin
haemoglobin
would
probably
be
interpreted
as
hemoglobin
AND
haemoglobin
which
would
pick
up
documents
written
by
international
committees
or
orthographically
challenged
expatriates
Some
websites
deliberately
include
both
spellings
using
a
synonym
dictionary
Similar
considerations
apply
to
sulfursulphur
for
example
If
you
wanted
to
know
about
other
dehydrogenases
you
could
ask
for
dehydrogenase
NOT
alcohol
This
would
retrieve
entries
that
contain
the
term
dehydrogenase
but
did
not
contain
the
word
alcohol
You
would
find
entries
about
lactate
dehydrogenase
malate
dehydrogenase
etc
You
would
miss
references
to
review
articles
that
compared
alcohol
dehydrogenases
with
other
dehydrogenases
or
alignments
of
the
sequences
of
many
dehydrogenases
including
alcohol
dehydrogenase
You
might
regret
missing
these
Many
database
search
engines
will
allow
complex
logical
expressions
such
as
haemoglobin
OR
hemoglobin
AND
dehydrogenase
NOT
alcohol
Construction
of
such
expressions
is
an
exercise
in
set
theory
Drawing
Venn
diagrams
helps
in
formulating
the
query
Although
the
logic
of
a
search
is
independent
of
the
software
used
to
query
a
database
different
programs
demand
different
syntax
to
express
the
same
conditions
For
example
the
query
for
dehydrogenase
NOT
alcohol
might
have
to
be
entered
as
DEHYDROGENASE
ALCOHOL
or
DEHYDOGENASEALCOHOL
Specialized
databases
including
those
in
molecular
biology
impose
a
structure
on
the
information
to
separate
different
categories
of
data
This
is
essential
The
biomedical
scientific
community
includes
people
named
Elisabetta
Coli
John
D
Yeast
Patrice
Rat
and
a
large
number
of
Rabbits
as
well
as
several
Crystals
and
Blots
If
you
wanted
to
find
papers
published
by
these
investigators
it
would
be
naive
to
perform
a
general
search
of
PubMed
or
some
other
molecular
biology
database
with
any
of
their
names
Many
databases
provide
separate
indexing
and
searching
of
different
categories
of
information
They
permit
searching
for
papers
of
which
E
Coli
is
an
author
Some
categories
such
as
taxonomy
have
controlled
vocabularies
Often
a
query
system
presents
the
vocabulary
terms
to
the
user
as
choices
from
pulldown
menus
The
structure
of
taxonomic
information
is
important
in
retrieval
To
do
a
search
for
globin
NOT
mammal
and
pick
out
the
relatively
few
entries
about
nonmammalian
globins
rather
than
the
very
many
entries
about
globins
including
human
haemoglobins
that
do
not
explicitly
mention
the
term
mammal
requires
an
informationretrieval
system
that
understands
the
taxonomic
hierarchy
Controlled
vocabularies
limited
explicit
and
carefully
defined
sets
of
terms
known
as
ontologies
are
also
important
for
distributing
queries
among
several
databases
A
technical
problem
that
frequently
creates
difficulty
is
how
to
enter
terms
containing
nonstandard
characters
such
as
accent
marks
or
umlauts
cedillas
Greek
letters
and
as
already
mentioned
differences
between
British
and
US
spelling
NCBIs
ENTREZ
can
handle
the
USBritish
spelling
differences
with
a
synonym
dictionary
Programs
that
index
the
entire
web
usually
do
not
Ignore
the
accent
marks
and
hope
for
the
best
Followup
questions
When
searching
in
databases
it
is
rare
that
you
will
find
exactly
what
you
want
on
the
first
round
of
178probing
Usually
you
have
to
modify
the
query
on
the
basis
of
the
results
initially
returned
Most
informationretrieval
software
permits
consecutive
cumulative
searches
with
altered
sets
of
search
terms
andor
logical
relationships
Conversely
once
you
find
what
you
were
looking
for
you
will
often
want
to
extend
your
search
to
find
related
material
If
you
find
a
gene
sequence
you
might
want
to
know
about
homologous
genes
in
other
organisms
or
whether
a
threedimensional
structure
of
the
corresponding
protein
is
available
Or
you
might
want
to
read
papers
published
about
the
sequence
For
these
subsidiary
queries
you
need
links
between
entries
in
the
same
or
different
databases
This
is
an
example
of
the
question
of
how
one
browses
in
electronic
libraries
which
is
a
difficult
problem
and
the
subject
of
current
research
Suppose
that
you
are
interested
in
a
particular
gene
To
find
homologous
genes
you
would
like
links
to
other
items
in
the
same
database
a
database
of
gene
sequences
To
find
structures
or
bibliographical
references
related
to
that
gene
you
would
like
links
between
different
databases
from
the
database
of
gene
sequences
to
a
database
of
threedimensional
structures
or
to
a
bibliographical
database
As
the
number
of
databases
and
the
variety
of
their
contents
grows
intercommunication
among
them
has
become
a
highpriority
goal
Indeed
the
interactivity
of
the
databases
in
molecular
biology
is
growing
more
and
more
effective
so
that
these
operations
are
fairly
easy
now
formerly
one
had
to
do
separate
searches
on
isolated
databases
NCBIs
ENTREZ
allows
selecting
a
set
of
databases
to
search
Alternatively
most
entries
in
molecular
biology
databases
contain
large
numbers
of
embedded
links
This
is
a
generalization
of
the
original
model
of
a
database
as
a
closed
set
of
independent
entries
that
can
be
selected
only
by
their
indexed
contents
One
must
think
of
the
web
as
a
very
highdimensional
space
Database
construction
in
bioinformatics
involves
activities
that
can
be
classified
to
some
extent
into
archiving
with
the
major
goals
of
conservation
and
curation
of
factsand
interpreting
and
annotating
the
compilation
of
biological
information
in
a
form
most
useful
to
support
research
Include
within
annotation
provision
of
links
to
other
databases
Many
archival
databases
specialize
in
different
kinds
of
datanucleic
acid
sequences
protein
sequences
or
macromolecular
structuresfor
reasons
in
part
historical
and
in
part
because
of
the
different
curatorial
skills
required
In
many
cases
archival
and
interpretative
projects
are
carried
out
at
the
same
institution
and
even
by
the
same
people
However
anyone
who
wishes
to
create
a
new
database
is
free
to
combine
and
repackage
information
from
any
available
sources
Practical
laboratory
experience
and
expert
knowledge
of
the
experimental
techniques
used
to
generate
the
data
are
essential
for
curating
an
archival
database
but
are
only
extremely
desirable
for
an
interpretative
database
Two
aspects
of
the
recent
development
of
bioinformatics
databases
stand
out
One
is
the
appearance
of
many
projects
that
recombine
the
archived
data
in
different
ways
The
other
is
the
combination
of
many
individual
databases
into
larger
and
larger
conglomerates
These
processes
overlap
and
sometimes
happen
together
Most
database
unifications
are
outgrowths
of
prior
collaborations
with
varying
degrees
of
intimacy
in
the
result
Analysis
and
processing
of
retrieved
data
Sometimes
as
a
result
of
a
search
you
will
want
to
launch
a
program
using
the
results
retrieved
for
its
input
For
instance
if
you
identify
a
protein
sequence
of
interest
you
might
want
to
perform
a
PSIBLAST
search
This
is
somewhat
different
from
a
strictly
keywordbased
database
entry
retrieval
problem
Formerly
you
would
have
to
run
one
job
to
search
for
your
data
store
the
results
179of
your
search
and
then
run
a
separate
second
job
feeding
the
retrieved
sequence
to
the
application
program
by
hand
However
like
searches
in
multiple
databases
several
informationretrieval
systems
in
molecular
biology
provide
facilities
for
initiating
such
calculations
This
makes
for
very
much
improved
fluency
in
your
sessions
at
the
computer
We
saw
an
example
in
Chapter
3
retrieving
C
elegans
serpins
and
feeding
the
sequences
into
a
multiple
alignment
program
The
archives
Although
our
knowledge
of
biological
data
is
very
far
from
complete
it
is
nevertheless
of
impressive
size
and
growing
extremely
rapidly
Many
scientists
are
working
to
generate
the
data
and
to
carry
out
research
projects
analysing
the
results
There
is
a
smooth
and
copious
flow
of
results
from
the
laboratory
bench
to
databanking
organizations
for
archiving
curation
and
distribution
to
the
research
laboratory
and
the
clinic
Archiving
of
bioinformatics
data
was
originally
carried
out
by
individual
research
groups
motivated
by
an
interest
in
the
associated
science
As
the
requirements
for
equipment
and
personnel
grewand
the
nature
of
the
skills
required
multiplied
to
include
much
more
emphasis
on
computer
sciencenational
and
in
most
cases
international
organizations
have
taken
on
the
responsibility
To
match
the
high
volumes
of
data
production
these
projects
have
become
very
large
scale
indeed
Anyone
who
has
followed
the
entire
history
of
the
field
cannot
help
being
impressed
by
the
replacement
of
tiny
lowprofile
and
illfunded
projects
carried
out
by
a
few
dedicated
individuals
to
a
multinational
heavy
industry
subject
to
hostile
takeovers
and
the
scientific
equivalent
of
leveraged
buyouts

Nucleic

The
worldwide
nucleic
acid
sequence
archive
is
a
triple
partnership
of
the
NCBI
USA
the
European
Nucleotide
Archive
or
ENA
at
the
EBI
UK
and
the
DNA
Data
Bank
of
Japan
National
Institute
of
Genetics
Japan
These
projects
curate
archive
and
distribute
DNA
and
RNA
sequences
collected
from
genome
projects
scientific
publications
and
patent
applications
The
groups
exchange
data
daily
As
a
result
the
raw
data
are
identical
However
the
format
in
which
they
are
presented
and
the
nature
of
the
annotation
vary
among
these
data
banks
To
ensure
that
these
fundamental
data
are
freely
available
scientific
journals
require
deposition
of
new
nucleotide
sequences
as
a
condition
for
publication
of
an
article
Similar
conditions
apply
to
nucleic
acid
and
180protein
structures
The
nucleic
acid
sequence
databases
as
distributed
are
collections
of
entries
Each
entry
has
the
form
of
a
text
file
containing
data
and
annotations
for
a
single
contiguous
sequence
Some
entries
are
assembled
from
several
published
papers
reporting
overlapping
fragments
of
a
complete
sequence
More
common
now
are
deposition
of
the
results
of
a
sequencing
and
assembly
of
complete
genomes
and
b
sequences
of
fragments
without
assembly
from
metagenomic
samples
Entries
have
a
life
history
Because
of
the
desire
on
the
part
of
the
user
community
for
rapid
access
to
data
new
entries
are
made
available
before
completion
of
annotation
and
checking
Entries
mature
through
the
classes
Unannotated
Preliminary
Unreviewed
Standard
Rarely
an

a
few
have
been
removed
when
they
are
determined
to
be

A
sample

from
the
European
Nucleotide
Archive
including
annotations
as
well
as

is
the
ATP7A
gene

regulating
copper

Mutations

Ensembl
Ensembl
httpwwwensemblorg
is
intended
to
be
the
universal
information
source
for
the
human
and
other
genomes
A
goal
is
to
collect
and
annotate
all
available
information
about
human
DNA
sequences
link
it
to
the
master
genome
sequence
and
make
it
accessible
to
the
many
scientists
who
will
approach
the
data
with
many
different
points
of
view
and
different
requirements
To
this
end
in
addition
to
collecting
and
organizing
the
information
very
serious
effort
has
gone
into
developing
computational
infrastructure
including
establishment
of
suitable
conventions
of
nomenclature
It
is
not
trivial
to
devise
a
scheme
for
maintaining
stable
identifiers
in
the
face
of
data
that
will
be
182undergoing
not
only
growth
but
revision
The
most
visible
result
of
these
efforts
is
the
website
very
rich
in
facilities
for
both
general
browsing
and
focusing
on
details
Ensembl
is
a
joint
project
of
the
EBI
and
the
Wellcome
Trust
Sanger
Institute
However
Ensembl
is
organized
as
an
open
project
encouraging
outside
contributions
All
but
the
most
naive
of
readers
must
recognize
the
great
demands
that
this
will
place
on
qualitycontrol
procedures
Data
collected
in
Ensembl
includes
genes
SNPs
repeats
and
homologies
Genes
may
either
be
known
experimentally
or
deduced
from
the

Because
the
experimental
support
for

of
the

is
so
variable
Ensembl

presents
the

for

UKcoordinated
their

the
UniProtKB
consortium
The
partners
in
this
enterprise
share
the

but
continue
to
offer
separate

for

The
PIR
grew
out
of
the
very
first
sequence
database
developed
by
Margaret
O
Dayhoff
the
pioneer
of
the
field
of
bioinformatics
SWISSPROT
was
developed
at
the
Swiss
Institute
of
Bioinformatics
TrEMBL
contains
the
translations
of
genes
identified
within
DNA
sequences
in
the
European
Nucleotide
Archive
TrEMBL
entries
are
regarded
as
preliminary
and
are
converted
after
curation
and
extended
annotationto
mature
entries
Today
almost
all
amino
acid
sequence
information
arises
from
translation
of
gene
sequences
However
even
the
amino
acid
sequence
of
a
protein
is
not
in
general
inferrable
with
confidence
from
the
gene
sequence
The
main
reason
in
eukaryotes
is
ambiguity
in
splicing
In
addition
information
about
ligands
disulphide
bridges
subunit
associations
posttranslational
modifications
effects
of
mRNA
editing
etc
is
not
available
from
nucleic

sequences
For
instance
from
genetic
information
alone
one
would
not
know
that
human
insulin
is
a
dimer
linked
by
disulphide
bridges
Proteinsequence

called
the

System
ExPASy
httpwwwexpasyorg
PROSITE
is
a
set
of
signature
patterns
characteristic
of
protein
families
Such
a
pattern
or
motif
or
signature
or
fingerprint
or
template
is
common
to
related
proteins
usually
because
of
the
requirements
of
binding
sites
that
constrain
the
evolution
of
the
protein
family
For
instance
the
consensus
pattern
for
inorganic
pyrophosphatase
is
DSGDNDPELIVMFDLIVMGAC
The
three
conserved
Ds
bind
divalent
metal
cations
Often
such
a
pattern
identifies
distant
relationships
not
otherwise
detectable
by
comparing
sequences
ExPASy
presents
certain
bioinformatics
tools
as
servers
on
its
website
and
has

to
many
others
Categories
of

roughly
half
of
which

Databases
of

Evolutionary
relationships
are
essential
for
making
sense
of
biological
data
Evolution
provides
the
framework
for
an
integrated
appreciation
of
the
properties
of
molecules
and
processes
and
their
similarities
and
difference
in
various
species
Perhaps
less
obvious
is
that
comparative
studies
illuminate
in
an
essential
way
even
individual
molecules
Knowing
only
a
single
sequence
or
structure
it
is
difficult
to
understand
the
significance
of
particular
features
Patterns
of
conservation
identify
features
that
nature
has
found
it
necessary
to
retain
PROSITE
signatures
are
examples
The
challenge
then
is
to
figure
out
why
Study
of
evolutionary
patterns
must
begin
with
assembling
a
set
of
homologues
We
again
emphasize
1
the
distinction
between
homology
descent
from
a
common
ancestora
yesorno
property
from
similarity
which
is
some
quantitative
measure
of
the
difference
between
two
objects
and
2
that
similarity
can
always
be
measured
but
it
is
rare
to
be
able
to
observe
homology
directly
therefore
in
most
cases
homology
is
an
inference
from
similarity
R
Doolittle
suggested
a
general
calibration
of
pairwise
sequence
similarity
for
homology
detection
Two
fulllength
protein
sequences
100
residues
that
have
25
or
more
identical
residues
in
an
optimal
alignment
are
likely
to
be
related
Below
15
identical
residues
in
an
optimal
alignment
and
we
become
mired
in
the
noise
In
this
range
of
similarity
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
sequences
are
related
although
they
might
be
Doolittle
defined
the
range
between
18
and
25
identity
as
the
twilight
zone
where
there
may
be
tantalizing
suspicion
of
a
relationship
but
the
evidence
falls
short
of
proof
In
some
cases
the
active
site
is
better
conserved
than
the
bulk
of
the
protein
In
these
cases
the
appearance
of
a
motifsuch
as
the
PROSITE
consensus
pattern
for
inorganic
pyrophosphatase
DSGDNDPELIVMFDLIVMGAC
can
support
the
case
for
homology
Multiple
sequence
alignments
are
much
more
powerful
than
pairwise
sequence
alignments
First
the
additional
data
allow
more
accurate
alignments
Second
the
conservation
patterns
stand
out
far
more
sharply
See
Problem
41
Protein
structure
changes
more
conservatively
than
amino
acid
sequence
Therefore
inference
of
homology
from
structural
similarity
can
link
more
distant
relatives
than
sequence
similarity
can
In
cases
that
lie
in
the
twilight
zone
where
sequence
similarity
is
suggestive
but
not
convincing
structural
similarity
is
the
court
of
last
resort
In
many
cases
structural
similarity
can
identify
homologues
even
if
no
signal
whateverat
least
no
signal
detectable
by
current
techniques
remains
in
the
sequences
It
is
common
to
refer
to
a
group
of
related
proteins
as
a
family
Many
databases
classify
proteins
into
families
These
include
sequenceoriented
databases
such
as
InterPro
Pfam
and
COG
and
structureoriented
databases
such
as
SCOP
and
CATH
The
assignment
of
proteins
to
families
is
similar
but
not
identical
in
various
sources
187Most
protein
families
contain
many
clusters
of
closer
relatives
These
form
subfamilies
Conversely
two
or
more
families
can
be
grouped
into
superfamilies
Whereas
the
distinction
between
homologous
and
nonhomologous
proteins
is
objective
even
if
we
cannot
determine
it
with
confidence
in
all
cases
the
clustering
of
homologues
into
subfamilies
or
superfamilies
is
partially
a
matter
of
convention
or
taste
Definition
of
subfamilies
and
superfamilies
may
legitimately
differ
among
different

The
wwPDB
assigns
a
fourcharacter
identifier
to
each
structure
deposited
The
first
character
is
a
number
from
1
to
9
Do
not
expect
mnemonic
significance
In
many
cases
several
entries
correspond
to
one
protein
solved
in
different
states
of
ligation
or
in
different
crystal
forms
or
resolved
using
better
crystals
or
more
accurate
datacollection
techniques
For
instance
there
have
been
at
least
four
generations
of
sperm
whale
myoglobin
crystal
structures
It
is
easy
to
retrieve
a
structure
if
you
know
its
identifier
From
the
RCSB
home
page
entering
a
PDB
ID
and
selecting

Searches
for
structures
Retrieval
of
a
particular
structure
is
easy
provided
that
you
know
its
identifier
If
not
how
do
you
find
it
A
simple
tool
accessible
from
the
RCSB
home
page
permits
a
search
for
keywords
Entering
SPINACH
THIOREDOXIN
returns
13
entries
including
1FAA
and
other
crystal
structures
of
the
same
molecule
or
mutants
in
different
oxidation
states
However
the
search
also
returns
several
structures
of
glyceraldehyde3phosphate
dehydrogenase
Why
This
is
because
embedded
in
the
dehydrogenase
structure
entries
is
a
reference
to
an
article
that
contains
the
word
thioredoxin
in
the
title
Nevertheless
the
information
returned
would
easily
permit
you
to
choose
structures
to
look
at
or
analyse
according
to
your
particular
interest
in
this
family
of
molecules
The
RCSB
site
also
offers
more
complex
browsers
Using
these
you
could
insist
that
the
keywords
appear
in
the
molecule
name
This
would
exclude
the
glyceraldehyde3phosphate
dehydrogenase
entries
Or
with
other
goals
you
could
constrain
the
method
of
structure
determination
and
set
limits
on
the
resolution
Here
we
have
discussed
searching
the
wwPDB
with
various
types
of
keywords
that
is
a
text
search
In
Chapter
6
we
shall
treat
the
problem
of
searching
a
structural
database
with
a
probe
structure
The
Macromolecular
Structure
Database
at
the
EBI
offers
a
useful
list
of
facilities
for
searching
and
browsing
the
wwPDB
Another
useful
information
source
available
at
the
EBI
is
the
database
of
Probable
Quaternary
Structures
PQS
of
the
biologically
active
forms
of
proteins
Often
the
asymmetric
unit
of
the
crystal
structure
as
deposited
in
the
PDB
entry
contains
only
part
of
the
active
unit
or
alternatively
multiple
copies
of
the
active
unit
For
many
entries
it
is
not
obvious
how
to
go
from
information
in
the
deposited
entry
to
the
active
form
The
EBI
deserves
credit
and
gratitude
from
the
entire
field
for
its
success
not
only
in
creating
databases
but
for
a
large
amount
of
extremely
useful
and
welldocumented
software
for
data
retrieval
and
analysis

193Accuracy
and
precision
of
protein
structure
determinations
Xray
crystallography
Xray
crystallography
produces
estimates
of
the
position
of
the
atoms
in
a
molecule
It
also
produces
estimates
of
their
effective
sizes
called
B
factors
An
important
feature
of
the
experimental
data
usually
measured
are
the
absolute
values
of
the
Fourier
coefficients
of
the
electron
density
is
that
all
atoms
contribute
to
all
observations
It
is
difficult
to
estimate
errors
in
individual
atomic
positions
For
small
molecules
forming
wellordered
crystals
B
factors
reflect
thermal
vibrational
amplitudes
For
protein
crystal
structures
B
factors
are
a
useful
index
of
the
precision
of
the
position
of
the
individual
atoms
B
factors
for
proteins
do
not
report
vibrational
amplitudes
exclusively
but
include
contributions
from
conformational
variability
A
colleague
who
read
this
page
in
draft
muttered
darkly
that
for
many
protein
structure
determinations
B
factors
cover
a
multitude
of
sins
Indeed
crystal
structure
determinations
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
degree
of
order
in
different
parts
of
the
molecule
Order
is
the
extent
to
which
different
unit
cells
of
the
crystal
are
exact
and
static
copies
of
one
another
The
degree
of
order
governs
the
available
resolution
of
the
experimental
data
Resolution
is
an
index
of
potential
quality
of
an
Xray
structure
determination
measuring
the
ratio
of
the
number
of
parameters
to
be
determined
to
the
number
of
observations
In
structure
determinations
of
small
organic
molecules
or
of
minerals
this
ratio
is
usually
generous
10
But
for
a
typical
protein
crystal
Resolution
measures
the
fineness
of
the
details
that
can
be
distinguished
hence
the
lower
the
number
the
higher
the
resolution
In
addition
to
disorder
errors
in
crystal
structures
reflect
errors
in
both
data
measurement
and
solving
the
structure
A
comparison
of
four
independently
solved
structures
of
interleukin1
showed
an
average
variation
in
atomic
position
of
084
higher
than
the
expected
experimental
error
Many
crystallographers
deposit
their
experimental
data
along
with
the
solved
structures
This
permits
detailed
checks
on
the
results
But
in
many
cases
the
experimental
data
are
not
available
How
can
one
then
assess
the
quality
of
a
structure
B
factors
provide
important
clues
high
B
factors
in
an
entire
region
suggest
that
the
region
is
not
well
determined
This
usually
reflects
imperfect
order
in
the
crystal
Programs
can
flag
stereochemical
outliers
exceptions
to
regularities
common
to
welldetermined
protein
structures
The
entries
corresponding
to
the
wwPDB
entries
in
httpwwwcmbikunnlgvpdbreport
describe
diagnostic
analysis
and
identification
of
problems
and
outliers
But
although
outliers
are
relatively
easy
to
detect
it
is
difficult
to
decide
whether
they
are
correct
but
unusual
features
of
the
structure
or
the
result
of
errors
in
building
the
model
or
the
inevitable
result
of
crystal
disorder
Proper
assessment
requires
access
to
the
experimental
data
and
fixing
real
errors
may
well
require
the
attention
of
an
experienced
crystallographer
The
conclusion
seems
inescapable
that
structure
factors
should
be
archived
and
available
Nuclear
magnetic
resonance
194Nuclear
magnetic
resonance
NMR
is
the
second
major
technique
for
determining
macromolecular
structure
It
produces
structures
that
are
correct
in
topology
but
often
not
as
precise
as
a
good
Xray
structure
determination
Crystallographers
report
a
single
structure
or
only
a
small
number
NMR
spectroscopists
usually
produce
a
family
of
1020
related
structures
or
even
more
calculated
from
the
same
experimental
data
Comparison
across
such
an
ensemble
indicates
precision
regions
in
which
the
local
variation
in
structure
is
small
are
well
defined
by
the
data
This
is
a
rough
equivalent
of
the
crystallographers
B
factor
There
are
two
sources
of
structural
variation
among
the
models
reported
by
NMR
spectroscopists
One
is
genuine
dynamic
disorder
arising
because
the
conformation
is
not
locked
in
by
crystal
packing
forces
The
other
is
an
uncomfortably
low
ratio
of
measurements
to
parameters
that
need
to
be
determined
As
a
result
several
different
conformations
may
fit
the
experimental
data
comparably
well
Analysis
of
NMR
measurements
can
distinguish
these
effects
but
is
carried
out
in
only
a
minority
of
NMR
protein
structure
determinations

Some
EST
collections
are
specialized
to
particular
tissues
eg
muscle
tooth
or
to
species
In
many
cases
there
is
an
effort
to
link
expression
patterns
to
other
knowledge
of
the
organism
For
instance
the
Jackson
Lab
Gene
Expression
Information
Resource
Project
for
Mouse
Development
196coordinates
data
on
gene
expression
and
developmental
anatomy
Many
databases
provide
connections
between
ESTs
in
different
species
for
instance
linking
human
and
mouse
homologues
or
relationships
between
human
disease
genes
and
yeast
proteins
Other
EST
collections
are
specialized
to
a
type
of
protein
for
instance
cytokines
A
large
effort
is
focused
on
cancer
integrating
information
on
mutations
chromosomal
rearrangements
and
changes
in
expression
patterns
to
identify
changes
during
tumour
formation
and
progression
Although
of
course
there
is
a
close
relationship
between
patterns
of
transcription
and
patterns
of
translation
direct
measurements
of
protein
contents
of
cells
and
tissuesproteomicsprovides
additional
valuable
information
Because
of
differential
rates
of
translation
and
turnover
of
different
mRNAs
measurements
of
proteins
directly
give
a
more
accurate
description
of
patterns
of
gene
expression
than
measurements
of
transcription
Posttranslational
modifications
can
be
detected
only
by
examining
the
proteins
Proteome
analysis
involves
separation
identification
and
quantitative
determination
of
amounts
of
proteins
present
in
the
sample
See
Chapter
9
Proteome
databases
store
images
of
gels
and
their
interpretation
in
terms
of
protein
patterns
For
each
protein
an
entry
typically
records
identification
of
protein
relative

mechanism
of

Bibliographic

Medline
based
at
the
US
National
Library
of
Medicine
integrates
the
medical
literature
including
very
many
papers
dealing
with
subjects
in
molecular
biology
that
are
not
overtly
clinical
in
content
It
is
included
in
PubMed
a
bibliographical
database
offering
abstracts
of
scientific
articles
integrated
with
other
informationretrieval
tools
of
the
NCBI
in
the
National
Library
of
Medicine
httpwwwncbinlmnihgovPubMed
One
very
effective
feature
of
PubMed
is
the
option
to
retrieve
related
articles
This
is
a
very
quick
way
to
get
into
the
literature
of
a
topic
Combined
with
the
use
of
a
general
search
engine
for
websites
that
do
not
correspond
to
articles
published
in
journals
fairly
comprehensive
information
is
readily
available
about
most
subjects
Heres
a
tip
if
you
are
trying
to
start
to
learn
about
an
unfamiliar
subject
try
adding
the
keyword
tutorial
to
your
search
in
a
general
search
engine
or
the
keyword
review
to
your
search
in
PubMed
Almost
all
scientific
journals
now
place
their
tables
of
contents
and
in
many
cases
their
entire
issues
on
websites
The
US
National
Institutes
of
Health
have
established
a
centralized
webbased
library
of
scientific
articles
called
PubMed
Central
httpwwwpubmedcentralnihgov
In
197collaboration
with
scientific
journals
the
NCBI
is
organizing
the
electronic
distribution
of
the
full
texts
of
published
articles
Surveys
of
molecular
biology
databases
and
servers
Lists
of
web
resources
in
molecular
biology
are
very
common
It
is
difficult
to
explore
any
topic
in
molecular
biology
on
the
web
without
quickly
bumping
into
a
list
of
this
nature
They
contain
to
a
large
extent
the
same
information
but
vary
widely
in
their
look
and
feel
The
real
problem
is
that
unless
they
are
curated
they
tend
to
degenerate
into
lists
of
dead
links
A
draft
of
this
section
featured
a
reference
to
a
website
that
contained
a
reasonable
survey
Returning
to
it
2
months
later
the
name
of
the
site
had
changed
and
over
half
of
the
links
had
disappeared
This
book
does
not
contain
a
long
annotated
list
of
relevant
and
recommended
sites
for
the
following
reasons
1
you
dont
want
a
long
list
you
need
a
short
one
and
2
the
web
is
too
volatile
for
such
a
list
to
stay
useful
for
very
long
It
is
much
more
effective
to
use
a
general
search
engine
to
find
what
you
want
at
the
moment
you
want
it
My
advice
is
this
spend
some
time
browsing
it
wont
take
you
long
to
find
a
site
that
appears
reasonably
stable
and
has
a
style
compatible
with
your
methods
of
work
Alternatively
the
ExPASy
site
see
the
section
on
The
Swiss
Institute
for
Bioinformatics
is
comprehensive
and
shows
signs
of
a
commitment
to
remaining
comprehensive
and

Gateways
to
archives
Databases
in
molecular
biology
maintain
facilities
for
a
very
wide
variety
of
informationretrieval
and
analysis
operations
Categories
of
these
operations
include
the
following
1
Retrieval
of
sequences
from
a
database
Sequences
can
be
called
up
on
the
basis
of
either
features
of
the
annotations
or
patterns
found
within
the
sequences
themselves
2
Sequence
comparison
This
is
not
a
facility
this
is
a
heavy
industry
It
was
introduced
in
Chapter
1
and
will
be
discussed
in
detail
in
Chapter
5
It
includes
the
very
important
searches
for
relatives
3
Identification
of
genes
in
genome
sequences
and
translation
of
proteincoding
gene
sequences
to
amino
acid
sequences
4
Simple
types
of
structure
analysis
and
prediction
for
example
statistical
methods
for
predicting
the
secondary
structure
of
proteins
from
sequences
alone
including
hydrophobicity
profiles
from
which
the
transmembrane
proteins
can
generally
be
identified
Other
sites
offer
full
three
dimensional
sequencetostructure
prediction
5
Pattern
recognition
It
is
possible
to
search
for
all
sequences
containing
a
pattern
or
combination
of
patterns
expressed
as
probabilities
for
finding
certain
sets
of
residues
at
consecutive
positions
These
patterns
may
extend
over
large
regions
of
the
sequence
Such
patterns
reflect
the
global
folding
pattern
of
a
protein
Other
patterns
are
short
In
DNA
sequences
these
patterns
may
reflect
recognition
sites
for
enzymes
such
as
those
responsible
for
splicing
together
interrupted
genes
In
proteins
short
and
localized
patterns
generally
identify
molecules
that
share
a
common
function
6
Molecular
graphics
are
necessary
to
provide
intelligible
depictions
of
very
complicated
systems
198Typical
applications
of
molecular
graphics
include
giving
a
useful
overall
impression
of
a
protein
folding
pattern
mapping
residues
believed
to
be
involved
in
function
on
to
the
threedimensional
framework
of
a
protein
Often
this
will
isolate
an
active
site
classifying
and
comparing
the
folding
patterns
of
proteins
analysing
changes
between
closely
related
structures
or
between
two
conformational
states
of
a
single
molecule
and
studying
the
interaction
of
a
small
molecule
with
a
protein
in
order
to
attempt
to
assign
function
or
for
drug
development
interactive
fitting
of
a
model
to
the
noisy
and
fuzzy
image
of
the
molecule
that
arises
initially
from
the
measurements
in
solving
protein
structures
by
Xray
crystallography
design
and
modelling
of
new
structures
Access

databases
in
molecular

How
to
learn
web
skills
It
would
be
difficult
to
learn
to
ride
a
bicycle
by
reading
a
book
describing
the
sets
of
movements
required
much
less
a
treatise
on
the
theory
of
the
gyroscope
Similarly
the
place
to
learn
web
skills
is
at
a
terminal
running
a
browser
True
enough
but
there
is
always
a
certain
initial
period
of
difficulty
and
imbalance
Here
the
goal
is
only
to
provide
some
temporary
assistance
to
get
you
started
Then
off
you
go
This
section
contains
introductions
to
some
of
the
major
data

and
informationretrieval
systems
in

In
each
case
the
illustrations
show
relatively
simple
searches
and
applications

Online
Mendelian

Online
Mendelian

OMIM
is
a
database
of
human
genes
and
genetic
disorders
It
was
originally
compiled
by
VA
McKusick
M
Smith
and
colleagues
and
published
on
paper
The
NCBI
has
developed
it
into
a
database
accessible
from
the
web
and
introduced
links
to
other
archives
of
related
information
including
sequence
data
banks
and
the
medical
literature
OMIM
is
now
well
integrated
with
the
NCBI
informationretrieval
system
ENTREZ
A
related
database
the
OMIM
Morbid
Map
treats
genetic
diseases
and
their
chromosomal
locations
The
response
to
ELASTASE
in
a
search
of
OMIM
describes
the
results
linking
mutations
in
the
gene
to
both
cyclic
and
congenital
noncyclic
neutropenia
OMIM
lists
nine
allelic
variants
many
more
are
known
Five
are
associated
with
cyclic
neutropenia
of
which
three
cause
amino
acid
substitutions
one
is
in
a
splice
site
and
one
is
in
an
intron
Four
variants
all
substitutions
are
associated
with
severe
congenital
neutropenia
The
collection
of
results
on
elastase
that
we
have
assembled
would
support
research
on
the
system
for
instance
we
could
map
elastase
mutants
onto
the
structure
of
the
molecule
to
see
whether
we
could
derive
clues
to
the
causes
of
cyclic
and
noncyclic
neutropenia
Evolution
of
elastase
In
addition
to
looking
at
the
clinical
relevance
of
elastase
its
interactions
and
its
mutants
we
might
be
interested
in
its
evolution
Although
elastase
has
many
homologues
in
the
human
genome
209digestive
enzymes
such
as
trypsin
and
chymotrypsin
and
proteins
involved
in
blood
clottingit
is
also
of
interest
to
see
how
widely
distributed
among
species
the
family
is
There
are
several
approaches
we
could
submit
the
sequence
of
human
leukocyte
elastase
to
PSIBLAST
collect
the
sequences
found
and
align
them
there
are
several
databases
collecting
protein
families
and
showing
their
sequence
alignments
an
example
is
Pfam
httppfamsangeracuk
SCOP
and
CATH
also
define
families
of
proteins
related
by
evolution
but
they
are
restricted
to
proteins
of
known
structure

Introduction
to
sequence
alignment
Given
two
or
more
sequences
we
wish
to
measure
their
similarity
determine
the
residueresidue
correspondences
observe
patterns
of
conservation
and
variability
infer
evolutionary
relationships
If
we
can
do
these
we
will
be
in
a
good
position
to
go
fishing
in
data
banks
for
related
sequences
A
major
application
is
to
the
annotation
of
genomes
involving
assignment
of
structure
and
function
to
as
many
genes
as
possible
How
can
we
define
a
quantitative
measure
of
sequence
similarity
Before
comparing
the
nucleotides
or
amino
acids
that
appear
at
corresponding
positions
in
two
or
more
sequences
we
must
first
assign
those
correspondences
Sequence
alignment
is
the
identification
of
residueresidue
correspondences
It
is
the
basic
tool
of
bioinformatics
Any
assignment
of
correspondences
that
preserves
the
order
of
the
residues
within
the
sequences
is
215an
alignment
Gaps
may
be
introduced
Given
two
first

A
reasonable
alignment
would
be

c
d
e
a

d
e

We
must
define
criteria
so
that
an
algorithm
can
choose
the
best
alignment

Most
readers
would
consider
the
last
of
these
alignments
the
best
of
the
four
To
confirm
this
and
to
decide
whether
it
is
the
best
of
all
possibilities
we
need
a
way
to
examine
all
possible
alignments
systematically
Then
we
need
to
compute
a
score
reflecting
the
quality
of
each
possible
alignment
Then
we
can
identify
the
alignment
with
the
optimal
score
In
many
cases
the
optimal
alignment
is
not
unique
several
different
alignments
may
give
the
same
best
score
Moreover
even
minor
variations
in
the
scoring
scheme
may
change
the
ranking
of
alignments
causing
a
different
one
to
emerge
as
the
best
These
examples
illustrate
pairwise
sequence
alignments
However
usually
we
can
find
large
families
of
similar
sequences
by
identifying
homologues
in
different
species
A
mutual
alignment
of
more
than
two
sequences
is
called
a
multiple
sequence
alignment
Multiple
sequence
alignments
are
much
more
informative
than
pairwise
sequence
alignments
in
terms
of
revealing
patterns
of
conservation
The
dotplot
The
dotplot
is
a
simple
picture
that
gives
an
overview
of
the
similarities
between
two
sequences
Less
obvious
is
its
close
relationship
to
alignments
The
dotplot
is
a
table
or
matrix
The
rows
correspond
to
the
residues
of
one
sequence
and
the
columns
to
the
residues
of
the
other
sequence
In
its
simplest
form
the
positions
in
the
dotplot
are
left
blank
if
the
residues
are
different
and
filled
if
they
match
Stretches
of
similar
residues
show
up
as
diagonals
in
the
upper
leftlower
right
northwestsoutheast
direction
see
Examples

52
and
53
The
dotplot
gives
a
quick
pictorial
statement
of
the
relationship
between
two
sequences
Obvious
features
of
similarity
stand
out
For
example
a
dotplot
relating
the
mitochondrial
ATPase6
genes
from
a
lamprey
Petromyzon
marinus
and
dogfish
Scyliorhinus
canicula
shows
that
the
similarity
of
the
sequences
is
weakest
near
the
beginning
This
gene
codes
for
a
subunit
of
the
ATPase
complex
In
the
human
mutations

this
gene

A
disadvantage
of
the
dotplot
is
that
its
reach
into
the
realm
of
distantly
related
sequences
is
poor
In
analysing
sequences
one
should
always
look
at
a
dotplot
to
be
sure
of
not
missing
anything
obvious
but
be
prepared
to
apply
more
sensitive
tools
Often
regions
of
similarity
may
be
displaced
to
appear
on
parallel
but
not
collinear
diagonals
This
indicates
that
insertions
or
deletions
have
occurred
in
the
segments
between
the
similar
regions
A
dotplot
relating
the
PAX6
protein
of
mouse
and
the
eyeless
protein
of
D
melanogaster
shows
three
extended
regions
of
similarity
with
different
lengths
of
sequence
between
them
two
near
the
beginning
of
the
sequences
and
one
near
the
middle
Between
the
second
and
third
of
them
there
is
a
longer
intervening
region
in
the
mouse
than
in
the
Drosophila
sequence
Filtering
the
results
can
reduce
the
noise
in
a
dotplot
In
the
comparison
of
the
ATPase
sequences
dots
were
not
shown
unless
they
were

the

of
a

of

containing

Dotplots
and
sequence
alignments
The
dotplot
captures
in
a
single
picture
not
only
the
overall
similarity
of
two
sequences
but
also
the
complete
set
and
relative
quality
of
different
possible
alignments
Any
path
through
the
dotplot
from
upper
left
to
lower
right
moving
from
each
point
only
in
the
east
south
or
southeast
directions
corresponds
to
a
possible
alignment
If
two
sequences
are
closely
related
the
alignment
can
be
read
directly
off
the
dotplot
Figure
51
shows
an
example
based
on
the
Dorothy
Hodgkin
dotplot
If
the
direction
of
the
move
between
successive
cells
is
diagonal
two
pairs
of
successive
residues
appear
in
the
alignment
without
an
insertion
between
them
If
the
direction
of
the
move
is
horizontal
a
gap
is
introduced
in
221the
sequence
indexing
the
rows
If
the
direction
of
the
move
is
vertical
a
gap
would
be
introduced
in
the
sequence
indexing
the
columns
Note
that
no
moves
can
be
directed
up
or
to
the
left
as
this
would
correspond
to
aligning
several
residues
of
one
sequence
with
only
one
residue
of
the
other
or
to
introducing
gaps
in
both
sequences
The
path
indicated
by
the
arrows
corresponds
to
the
obvious
alignment

Any
path
through
the
dotplot
from
upper
left
to
lower
right
passes
through
a
succession
of
cells
each
of
which
picks
out
a
pair
of
positions
one
from
the
row
and
one
from
the
column
that
are
matched
in
the
alignment
that
corresponds
to
that
path
or
that
indicates
a
gap
in
one
of
the
sequences
The
path
need
not
pass
through
filledin
points
only
However
the
more
filledin
points
on
the
path
the
more
matching
residues
in
the
alignment
Another
way
to
think
of
a
path
through
the
dotplot
is
as
an
edit
script
that
is
a
prescription
of
a
series
of
operations
that
transforms
the
sequence
that
indexes
the
columnsthe
horizontal
sequenceinto
the
sequence
that
indexes
the
rows
or
the
vertical
sequence
Each
move
tells
us
to
perform
an
operation
a
substitution
an
insertion
or
a
deletion
When
the
end
of
the
path
is
reached
the
effect
will
be
to
change
one
sequence
into
the
other
In
many
cases
several
different
sequences
of
edit
operations
may
convert
one
string
into
the
other
in
the
same
number
of
steps
but
they
induce
different
alignments
It
should
be
emphasized
that
although
a
sequence
of
edit
operations
derived
from
an
optimal
alignment
may
correspond
to
an
actual
set
of
evolutionary
events
it
is
impossible
to
prove
that
it
does
The
larger
the
edit
distance
the
larger
the
number
of
reasonable
evolutionary
pathways
between
two
sequences
Moreover
an
alignment
does
not
contain
any
information
about
the
order
of
occurrence
of
the
sequence
changes
during
evolution

Measures
of
sequence
similarity
To
go
beyond
alignment
by
eyeball
via
dotplots
we
must
define
quantitative
measures
of
sequence
similarity
and
difference
Given
two
character
strings
two
measures
of
the
distance
between
them
are
1
the
Hamming
distance
defined
between
two
strings
of
equal
length
is
the
number
of
positions
with
mismatching
characters

Dotplots

Let
us
compare
the
appearance
of
dotplots
between
pairs
of
proteins
with
increasingly
more
distant
relationships

As
the

progressively
diverge
it
becomes
more
and
more

to
spot
the

in

from

conservative
the
replacement
of
one
amino
acid
by
another
with
similar
size
or
physicochemical
properties
is
more
likely
to
have
occurred
than
its
replacement
by
another
amino
acid
with
greater
224differences
Or
the
deletion
of
a
succession
of
contiguous
bases
or
amino
acids
is
a
more
probable
event
than
the
independent
deletion
of
the
same
number
of
bases
or
amino
acids
at
noncontiguous
positions
in
the
sequences
Therefore
we
may
wish
to
assign
variable
weights
to
different
edit
operations
A
computer
program
can
then
determine
not
just
minimal
edit
distances
but
optimal
alignments
It
can
score
each
path
by
adding
up
the
scores
of
the
individual
steps
For
substitutions
it
adds
the
score
of
the
mutation
depending
on
the
pair
of
residues
involved
For
horizontal
and
vertical
moves
it
adds
a
suitable
gap
penalty
Scoring
schemes
A
scoring
system
must
account
for
residue
substitutions
and
insertions
or
deletions
Deletions
or
gaps
in
a
sequence
will
have
scores
that
depend
on
their
lengths
Hamming
and
Levenshtein
distances
measure
the
dissimilarity
of
two
sequences
similar
sequences
give
small
distances
and
dissimilar
sequences
give
large
distances
It
is
common
in
molecular
biology
to
define
scores
as
measures
of
sequence
similarity
Then
similar
sequences
give
high
scores
and
dissimilar
sequences
give
low
scores
These
are
equivalent
formulations
Algorithms
for
optimal
alignment
can
seek
either
to
minimize
a
dissimilarity
measure
or
to
maximize
a
scoring
function
For
nucleic
acid
sequences
it
is
common
to
use
a
simple
scheme
for
substitutions
1
for
a
match
1
for
a
mismatch
or
a
more
complicated
scheme
based
on
a
higher
frequency
of
transition
mutations
than
transversion
mutations
See
Example
54
For
proteins
a
variety
of
scoring
schemes
have
been
proposed
We
might
group
the
amino
acids
into
classes
of
similar
physicochemical
type
and
score
1
for
a
match
within
residue
class
and
1
for
residues
in
different
classes
We
might
try
to
devise
a
more
precise
substitution
score
from
a
combination
of
properties
of
the
amino
acids
Alternatively
we
might
try
to
let
the
proteins
teach
us
an
appropriate
scoring
scheme
MO
Dayhoff
did
this
first
by
collecting
statistics
on
substitution
frequencies
in
the
protein
sequences
then
known
Her
results
were
used
for
many
years
to
score
alignments
They
have
been
superseded
by
Example

Suggest
a
substitution
matrix
that
reflects
this
The
higher
the
value
in
the
matrix
the
more
favourable
the
contribution
to
the
alignment
score
One
possibility
is
newer
matrices
based
on
the
very
much
larger
set
of
sequences
that
has
subsequently
become
available
225Derivation
of
substitution
matrices
PAM
and
BLOSUM
matrices
As
sequences
diverge
mutations
accumulate
To
measure
the
relative
probability
of
any
particular
substitution
for
instance
serinethreonine
we
can
count
the
number
of
serinethreonine
changes
in
pairs
of
aligned
homologous
sequences
We
could
use
the
relative
frequencies
of
such
changes
to
form
a
scoring
matrix
for
substitutions
A
common
change
should
score
higher
than
a
rare
one
But
what
if
there
have
been
multiple
substitutions
at
certain
sites
This
will
bias
the
statistics
We
can
avoid
this
problem
by
restricting
our
samples
to
sequences
that
are
sufficiently
similar
that
we
can
assume
that
no
position
has
changed
more
than
once
A
measure
of
sequence
divergence
is
the
PAM
where
1
PAM
1
per
cent
accepted
mutation
Thus
two
sequences
1
PAM
apart
have
99
identical
residues
For
pairs
of
sequences
within
the
1
PAM
level
of
divergence
it
is
likely
that
there
has
been
no
more
than
one
change
at
any
position
Collecting
statistics
from
pairs
of
sequences
as
closely
related
as
this
and
correcting
for
different
amino
acid
abundances
produces
the
1
PAM
substitution
matrix
To
produce
a
matrix
appropriate
for
more
widely
divergent
sequences
we
can
take
powers
of
this
matrix
The
PAM250
level
corresponding
to
20
overall
sequence
identity
is
the
lowest
sequence
similarity
for
which
we
can
hope
to
produce
a
correct
alignment
by
simple
pairwise
sequence
comparison
alone
It
is
therefore
the
appropriate
level
to
choose
for
practical
work
Several
authors
have
derived
substitution
matrices
appropriate
in
different
ranges
of
overall
sequence
similarity
The
occurrence
of
reversions
either
directly
or
via
one
or
more
other
changes
produces
an
apparent
slowdown
in
mutation
rates
as
sequences
progressively
diverge
The
relationship
between
PAM
score
and
percentage
sequence
identity
is
The
PAM250
matrix
of
MO
Dayhoff
is
shown
in

It
expresses
scores
as
logodds

Only
the
lower

of

as

This
is
not
because
we
are
sure
that
the
rate
of
any

is
the
same
as
the
rate
of
its
reverse
but
because
we

between
the
two

CSimplies
that
in
related
sequences
the

would
be
expected
to
occur

more
frequently
than
random
The
calculation
is
as
follows
the
matrix
entry
2
corresponds
to
the
actual
value
02
because
of
the
scaling
The
value
02
is
log
10
of
the
relative
expectation
value
of
the

Therefore
this
227expectation
value
is

The
probability
of

independent
mutational
events
is
the
product
of
their
probabilities
By
using
logs
we
have
scores
that
we
can
add
up
rather
than
multiply

computational
convenience
The
BLOSUM
matrices
S
Henikoff
and
JG
Henikoff
developed
the
family
of
BLOSUM
matrices
for
scoring
substitutions
in
amino
acid
sequence
comparisons
Their
goal
was
to
replace
the
Dayhoff
matrix
with
one
that
would
perform
best
in
identifying
distant
relationships
making
use
of
the
much
larger
amount
of
sequence
data
that
had
become
available
since
Dayhoffs
work
The
BLOSUM
matrices
are
based
on
the
BLOCKS
database
of
aligned
protein
sequences
hence
the
name
BLOcks
SUbstitution
Matrix
From
regions
of
closely
related
proteins
alignable
without
gaps
Henikoff
and
Henikoff
calculated
the
ratio
of
the
number
of
observed
pairs
of
amino
acids
at
any
position
to
the
number
of
pairs
expected
from
the
overall
amino
acid
frequencies
Like
the
Dayhoff
matrix
the
results
are
expressed
as
logodds
In
order
to
avoid
overweighting
closely
related
sequences
the
Henikoffs
replaced
groups
of
proteins
that
have
sequence
identities
higher
than
a
threshold
by
either
a
single
representative
or
a
weighted
average
The
threshold

produces
the
commonly
used
BLOSUM62

This
is

by

option
and

To

For

CLUSTALW
recommends
use
of
the

for

1
for
a

0
for
a

and
gap
penalties
of
10
for

and
01
for

by
one
residue
For
aligning
protein
sequences
the
recommendations
are
to
use
the
BLOSUM62
matrix
for
substitutions
and
gap
penalties
of
11
for
gap

and
1
for

Computing
the
alignment
of
two
sequences
Now
that
we
have
a
scoring
scheme
we
can
apply
it
to
finding
optimal
alignments
we
seek
the
alignment
that
maximizes
the
score
A
famous
algorithm
to
determine
the
global
optimal
alignments
of
two
sequences
is
based
on
a
mathematical
technique
called
dynamic
programming
Details
appear
in
the
next
section
This
algorithm
has
been
extremely
important
in
molecular
biology
Some
noteworthy
features
are
as
follows
The
good
news
is
that
the
method
is
guaranteed
to
give
an
optimal
global
alignment
It
will
find
the
best
alignment
score
given
the
choice
of
parameterssubstitution
matrix
and
gap
penalty
228with
no
approximation
The
bad
news
is
that
many
alignments
may
give
the
same
optimal
score
and
none
of
these
need
correspond
to
the
biologically
correct
alignment
For
instance
in
comparing
the
and
chains
of
chicken
haemoglobin
W
Fitch
and
T
Smith
found
17
alignments
all
of
which
give
the
same
optimal
score
and
one
of
which
is
correct
on
the
basis
of
the
structures
the
court
of
last
resort
There
are
1317
alignments
with
scores
within
5
of
the
optimum
Another
item
of
bad
news
is
technical
the
time
required
to
align
two
sequences
of
lengths
n
and
m
is
proportional
to
n
m
because
this
is
the
size
of
the
edit
matrix
that
must
be
filled
in
This
means
that
the
dynamicprogramming
method
is
not
convenient
to
use
for
searching
in
an
entire
sequence
database
for
a
match
to
a
probe
sequence
and
even
less
convenient
for
allagainstall
alignments
The
database
search
problem
is
in
effect
the
problem
of
matching
a
probe
sequence
to
a
region
of
a
very
long
sequence
the
length
of
the
entire
database
Variations
and
generalizations
Variations
of
the
dynamicprogramming
method
apply
to
three
related
alignment
questions
entire
sequence
against
entire
sequence
region
of
one
sequence
against
entire
other
sequence
and
region
of
one
sequence
against
region
of
other
sequence

Approximate
methods
for

screening
of
databases
It
is
routine
to
screen
genes
from
a
new
genome
against
the
databases
for
similarity
to
other
sequences
Approximate
methods
can
detect
close
relationships
well
and
quickly
but
are
inferior
to
the
exact
ones
in
picking
up
very
distant
relationships
In
practice
they
give
satisfactory
performance
in
the
many
cases
in
which
the
probe
sequence
is
fairly
similar
to
one
or
more
sequences
in
the
data
bank
They
are
therefore
worth
trying
first
We
have
already
seen
an
example
of
PSIBLAST
in
Chapter
1
A
typical
approximation
approach
would
take
a
small
integer
k
and
determine
all
instances
of
each
k
tuple
of
residues
in
the
probe
sequence
that
occur
in
any
sequence
in
the
database
A
candidate
sequence
is
a
sequence
in
the
data
bank
containing
a
large
number
of
matching
k
tuples
with
equivalent
spacing
in
probe
and
candidate
sequences
229There
are
several
variations
on
this
theme
including
the
original
BLAST
program
and
its
variants
see
Box
53
For
a
selected
set
of
candidate
sequences
approximate
optimal
alignment
calculations
are
then
carried
out
with
the
time
and
spacesaving
restriction
that
the
paths
through
the
matrix
that
can
be
considered
are
restricted
to
bands
around
the
diagonals
containing
the
many
matching
k
tuples
It
is
clearest
to
show
the
procedure
in
terms
of
a

BLAST

the
problem
of

sequence
in
a

or
a
full
database
that
is
much
longer
than
the

The
playing
field
of
the
algorithm
is
the
outline
of
a
dotplot
just
as
if
the
problem
were
going
to
be
solved
by
application
of
an
exact
alignment
method
2
BLAST
first
divides
the
probe
sequence
into
fixedlength
words
of
length
k
here
k
4
It
then
identifies
all
exact
occurrences
of
these
words
in
the
full
database
no
mismatches
no
gaps
Note
that
the
same
fourletter
word
may
occur
several
times
in
the
probe
sequence
shown
here
in
green
and
of
course
each
fourletter
word
may
match
many
times
within
the
database
It
is
possible
to
do
this
step
quickly
after
preprocessing
the
database
to
record
the
sites
of
appearance
of
all
fourletter
words
3
Starting
with
each
match
BLAST
tries
to
extend
the
match
in
both
directions
Still
no
mismatches
no
gaps
allowed
4
Given
the
extended
matches
BLAST
tries
to
put
them
together
by
doing
alignments
allowing
mismatches
and
gaps
but
only
within
limited
regions
containing
the
preliminary
matches
grey
areas
The
result
of
this
step
is
to
add
to
the
matches
the
positions
shown
as
This
produces
longer
matching
regions
It
is
the
restriction
of
the
more
complex
matching
procedure
to
relatively
small
regions
rather
than
applying
it
to
the
entire
matrix
that
gives
the
method
its
speed
The
price
to
pay
is
that
if
a
combined
match
lies
outside
the
grey
area
the
method
will
miss
it
In
the
example
illustrated
the
matching
regions
at
the
right
of
the
matrix
will
not
be
combined
but
reported
as
separate

lowest
cost
and
the
difficulty
is
that
there
are
a
very
large
number
of
paths
to
consider
230As
an
illustration
suppose
you
wanted
to
drive
from
Malm
in
southern
Sweden
to
Troms
in
northern
Norway
Your
route
will
consist
of
a
number
of
segments
taking
you
through
a
succession
of
intermediate
cities
see
Fig
54
There
are
many
choices
of
different
combinations
of
segments
to
produce
a
complete
continuous
path

Possible
routes
from
Malm
to
Troms
How
can
you
determine
an
optimal
route
Collins
Bartholemew
Ltd
1980
The
computational
approach
to
finding
the
optimal
path
begins
by
assigning
a
numerical
measure
of
the
cost
to
each
of
the
possible
individual
segments
of
the
journey
This
cost
is
not
simply
the
financial
outlay
but
a
more
general
estimate
of
your
relative
preferences
for
different
portions
of
the
route
The
distance
travelled
will
clearly
be
an
important
component
of
the
cost
but
other
factors
such
as
the
quality
of
the
roads
and
the
opportunities
for
sightseeing
may
also
contribute
For
any
route
selected
the
overall
cost
of
the
trip
is
the
sum
of
the
costs
of
the
individual
segments
Clearly
it
is
inefficient
to
repeat
any
leg
of
the
journey
or
to
visit
any
city
twice
so
we
will
agree
that
every
intermediate
stop
will
be
north
of
the
previous
one
This
formalism
is
expressed
in
terms
of
minimizing
a
cost
rather
than
maximizing
a
score
for
our
purposes
the
two
approaches
are
equivalent
An
algorithm
can
explore
the
possible
combinations
to
determine
an
optimal
overall
route
Here
is
an
abstract
version
of
the
problem
which
illuminates
the
essential
idea
of
dynamic
programming
Consider
first
how
many
paths
from
Start
to
Finish
pass
through
A
There
are
six
paths
from
Start
to
A
Write
them
all
down
Therefore
by
symmetry
there
are
six
paths
from
A
to
Finish
and
a
231total
of
36
paths
from
Start
to
Finish
passing
through
A
Why
Assuming
that
we
have
assigned
costs
to
the
individual
steps
do
we
have
to
check
all
36
paths
to
find
the
path
of
minimum
cost
that
goes
from
Start
to
Finish
passing
through
A
No
Here
is
the
crucial
observation
the
choice
of
the
best
path
from
A
to
Finish
is
independent
of
the
choice
of
path
from
the
Start
to
A
If
we
determine
the
best
of
the
six
paths
from
Start
to
A
and
we
determine
the
best
of
the
six
paths
from
A
to
Finish
the
best
path
from
Start
to
Finish
passing
through
A
is
the
best
path
from
Start
to
A
followed
by
the
best
path
from
A
to
Finish
No
more
than
12
of
the
paths
through
A
need
be
considered
Even
greater
simplification
is
possible
by
systematically
resubdividing
the
problem
The
dynamicprogramming
method
for
finding
the
optimal
path
through
the
matrix
is
based
on
this
idea
A
statement
of
the
optimal
alignment
problem
and
the
dynamicprogramming
solution
are
as
follows
Given
two
character
strings
possibly
of
unequal
length
A
a
1
a
2
a
n
and
B
b
1
b
2
b
m
where
each
a
i
and
b
j
is
a
member
of
an
alphabet
set
consider
sequences
of
edit
operations
that
convert
A
and
B
to
a
common
sequence
Individual
edit
operations
include
If
we
extend
the
alphabet
set
to
include
the
null
character
a
sequence
of
edit
operations
is
a
set
of
ordered
pairs
x
y
with
A
cost
function
d
is
defined
on
edit
operations
Define
the
minimum
weighted
distance
between
sequences
A
and
B
as
where
and
the
minimum
is
taken
over
all
sequences
of
edit
operations
that
convert
A
and
B
into
a
common
sequence
The
problem
is
to
find
D
A
B
and
one
or
more
of
the
alignments
that
correspond
to
it
An
algorithm
that
solves
this
problem
requiring
execution
time
proportional
to
the
product
of
the
lengths
of
the
two
sequences
creates
a
matrix
i
j
i
0
n
j
0
m
such
that
i
j
is
the
minimal
distance
between
the
strings
that
consist
of
the
first
i
characters
of
A
and
the
first
j
characters
of
B
Then
n
m
will
be
the
required
minimal
distance
D
A
B
The
algorithm
computes
i
j
by
recursion
The
value
of
i
j
corresponds
to
the
conversion
of
the
initial
subsequences
A
i
a
1
a
2
a
i
and
B

into
a
common
sequence
by
L
edit
operations
S
k
k

L
which
can
be
considered
to
be
applied
in
increasing
order
of
position
in
the
strings
Consider
undoing
the
last
of
these
edit
operations
The
resulting
truncated
sequence
of
edit
232operations
S
k
k
1
L
1
is
a
sequence
of
edit
operations
for
converting
a
substring
of
A
i
and
a
substring
of
B
j
into
a
common
result
What
is
more
it
must
be
an
optimal
sequence
of
edit
operations
for
these
substrings
for
if
some
other
sequence
were
a
lowercost
sequence
of
operations
for
these
substrings
then
followed
by
S
L
would
be
a
lowercost
sequence
of
operations
than
S
k
for
converting
A
i
to
B
j
Therefore
there
should
be
a
recursive
method
for
calculating
the
i
j
Recognize
the
correspondence
of
steps
between
adjacent
squares
in
the
matrix
and
individual
edit
operations

Considering
the

the

of
the

is
the

we
have

For

purposes
we
would
also
draw
an
arrow
from
the
value
of

just
entered
back
to
the
0
at
the
upper

If
two
or
even
three
of

possible

produce
the

the
resulting

has
multiple
predecessors
Here
is
the
matrix
after
completion
of
the
calculation
234It
includes
the
traceback
information
in
the
form
of
arrows
pointing
from
each
cell
to
its
predecessors
For
some
applications
we
may
need
only
the
value
of
D
A
B
but
not
an
alignment
if
so
it
is
unnecessary
to
save
the

Boldface
arrows
delineate
the
paths
of
optimal
alignment
retracing
a
trail
of
predecessors
from
lower
right
back
to
upper
left
In
some
cases
one
cell
may
show
two
predecessors
These
correspond
to
alternative
alignments
with
the
same
score
There
are
two
cells
at
which
the
traceback
path
branches
This
gives
a
total
of
four
optimal
alignments
with
equal
score
With
a
gapweighting
scheme
that
assigned
a
smaller
penalty
to
gap
extension
than
to
gap
initiation
the
first
two
of
these
would
score
better
than
the
others
because
they
contain
the
smallest
number
of
gaps
irrespective
of
the
length
of
the
individual
gaps
However
more
sophisticated
gapweighting
schemes
require
more
complicated
recurrence
formulas
for
filling
the
matrix
This
algorithm
determines
the
optimal
global
alignment
of
two
sequences
It
is
inappropriate
for
detection
of
local
regions
of
high
similarity
within
two
sequences
or
for
probing
a
long
sequence
with
a
short
fragment
because
it
imposes
gap
penalties
outside
the
similar
regions
The
method
of
T
Smith
and
M
Waterman
solves
this
problem
Their
modifications
of
the
basic
dynamicprogramming
algorithm
find
optimal
local
alignments
that
is
they
select
the
substrings
from
both
sequences
that
are
most
similar
to
each
other
Their
changes
affect
the
following
aspects

the
top

In
the
SmithWaterman
method

are
set
to

As
a
result
either
sequence
can
slide
along
the
other
before
alignment
starts
without
incurring
any
gap
penalty
against
the
residues
it
passes
by

Filling
in
the
matrix
in
global
alignment
at
each
step
a
choice
is
forced
among
match
insertion
or
deletion
even
if
none
of
these
choices
is
attractive
and
even
if
a
succession
of
unattractive
choices
degrades
the
score
along
a
path
containing
a
wellfitting
local
region
The
SmithWaterman
method
adds
the
fourth
option
end
the
region

Scoring
and
traceback
the
score
of
a
global
alignment
is
the
number
in
the
matrix
element
at
the
lower
right
In
the
SmithWaterman
method
it
is
the
optimal
value
encountered
wherever
in
the
matrix
it
appears
For
global
alignment
traceback
to
determine
the
actual
alignment
starts
at
the
lowerright
cell
In
the
Smith
Waterman
method
it
starts
at
the
cell
containing
the
optimal
value
and
continues
back
only
as
far
as
the
region
of
local
similarity
continues
The
SmithWaterman
method
would
report
a
unique
global
optimum
for
our

Significance
of
alignments
Suppose
alignment
reveals
an
intriguing
similarity
between
two
sequences
Is
the
similarity
significant
or
could
it
have
arisen
by
chance
We
raised
this
question
in
Chapter
1
For
some
simple
phenomenatossing
a
coin
or
rolling
diceit
is
possible
to
calculate
exactly
the
expected
distribution
of
results
and
the
likelihood
of
any
particular
result
For
sequences
it
is
not
trivial
to
define
the
population
from
which
the
alignment
is
selected
For
instance
to
take
random
strings
of
nucleotides
or
amino
acids
as
controls
ignores
the
bias
arising
from
nonrandom
composition
A
practical
approach
to
the
problem
is
as
follows
if
the
score
of
the
alignment
observed
is
no
better
than
might
be
expected
from
the
corresponding
alignment
of
a
random
permutation
of
the
sequence
then
it
is
likely
to
have
arisen
by
chance
We
may
randomize
one
of
the
sequences
many
times
realign
each
result
to
the
second
sequence
held
fixed
and
collect
the
distribution
of
resulting
scores
Figure
55
shows
a
typical
result
For
database
searches
we
would
use
the
population
of
results
returned
from
the
entire
database
as
the
population
with
which
to
measure
the
statistics
Figure
55
Optimal
local
alignment
scores
for
pairs
of
random
amino
acid
sequences
of
the
same
length
follow
an
extreme
value
distribution
For
any
score
x
the
probability
of
observing
a
score
x
is
where
K
and
are
parameters
related
to
the
position
of
the
maximum
and
the
width
of
the
distribution
Note
the
long
tail
at
the
right
This
means
that
a
score
several
standard
deviations
above
the
mean
has
a
higher
probability
of
arising
by
chance
ie
it
is
less
significant
than
if
the
scores
followed
a
normal
distribution
Clearly
if
the
randomized
sequences
score
as
well
as
the
original
one
then
the
alignment
is
unlikely
to
be
significant
We
can
measure
the
mean
and
standard
deviation
of
the
scores
of
the
alignments
of
randomized
sequences
and
ask
whether
the
score
of
original
sequence
is
unusually
high
The
Z
score
reflects
the
extent
to
which
the
original
result
is
an
outlier
from
the
population
A
Z
score
of
0
means
that
the
observed
similarity
is
no
better
than
the
average
of
random
permutations
of
the
sequence
and
might
well
have
arisen
by
chance
Other
values
used
as
measures
of
significance
are
P
or
the
probability
that
the
observed
match
could
have
happened
by
chance
and
for
database
searching
E
which
is
the
number
of
matches
as
good
as
the
observed
one
that
would
be
expected
to
appear
by
chance
in
a
database
of
the
size
probed

Box

236Many
rules
of
thumb
are
expressed
in
terms
of
percentage
of
identical
residues
in
the
optimal
alignment
If
two
proteins
have
more
than
45
identical
residues
in
their
optimal
alignment
they
will
have
very
similar
structures
and
are
very
likely
to
have
a
common
or
at
least
a
similar
function
If
two
proteins
have
greater
than
25
identical
residues
they
are
likely
to
have
a
similar
general
folding
pattern
On
the
other
hand
observations
of
a
lower
degree
of
sequence
similarity
cannot
rule
out
homology
Recall
RF
Doolittles
definition
of
the
region
of
1825
sequence
identity
as
the
twilight
zone
in
which
the
suggestion
of
homology
is
tantalizing
but
dangerous
Below
the
twilight
zone
is
a
region
where
pairwise
sequence
alignments
tell
very
little
Lack
of
significant
sequence
similarity
does
not
preclude
genuine
homology
Although
the
twilight
zone
is
a
treacherous
region
we
are
not
entirely
helpless
In
deciding
whether
there
is
a
genuine
relationship
the
texture
of
the
alignment
is
important
are
the
similar
residues
isolated

How
to
play
with
matches
but
not
get
burned
Pairwise
alignments
and
database
searches
often
show
tenuous
but
tantalizing
sequence
similarities
How
can
we
decide
whether
we
are
seeing
a
true
relationship
Statistics
cannot
answer
biological
questions
directly
but
can
tell
us
the
likelihood
that
a
similarity
as
good
as
the
one
observed
would
appear
just
by
chance
among
unrelated
sequences
To
do
this
we
want
to
compare
our
result
with
alignments
of
the
same
sequences
to
a
large
population
This
control
population
should
be
similar
in
general
features
to
our
aligned
sequences
but
should
contain
few
sequences
related
to
them
Only
if
the
observed
match
stands
out
from
the
population
can
we
regard
it
as
significant
To
what
population
of
sequences
should
we
compare
our
alignment
For
pairwise
alignments
we
can
pick
one
of

make
many
scrambled
copies
of
it

generator
and
align
each
permuted
copy
to
the

For
probing
a
database
the
entire

Aligning
our

to
each

of

generates
a
large
set
of
scores
How
does
the
score
of
our
original
alignment
rate
Several
statistical
parameters
have
been
used
to
evaluate
the
significance
of
alignments
as
follows
The
Z
score
is
a
measure
of
how
unusual
our
original
match
is
in
terms
of
the
mean
and
standard
deviation
of
the
population
scores
If
the
original
alignment
has
score
S
A
Z
score
of
0
means
that
the
observed
similarity
is
no
better
than
the
average
of
the
control
population
and
might
well
have
arisen
by
chance
The
higher
the
Z
score
the
greater
the
probability
that
the
observed
alignment
has
not
arisen
simply
by
chance
Experience
suggests
that
Z
scores
5
are
significant
Many
programs
report
P
the
probability
that
the
alignment
is
better
than
random
The
relationship
between
Z
and
P
depends
on
the
distribution
of
the
scores
from
the
control
population
which
do
not
follow
the
normal
distribution

The

that
give
the

Statistics
are

but
not
a
substitute
for
thinking
carefully
about
the
results
and
further
analysis
of

that
look

scattered
throughout
the

or
are

Are
there
local

of

another
term
of
Doolittles
that
may
correspond
to
a
shared
active
site
We
may
need
to
rely
on
other
information
about
shared
ligands
or
function
Of
course
if
the
structures
are
known
we
could
examine
them
directly
Some
illustrative
examples
are
listed
here
Sperm
whale
myoglobin
and
lupin
leghaemoglobin
have
15
identical
residues
in
optimal
alignment
This
is
even
below
Doolittles
definition
of
the
twilight
zone
But
we
also
know
that
both
molecules
have
similar
threedimensional
structures
and
that
both
contain
a
haem
group
and
both
bind
oxygen
They
are
indeed
distantly
related
homologues
The
sequences
of
the
N
and
C
terminal
halves
of
rhodanese
have
11
identical
residues
in
optimal
alignment
If
these
appeared
in
independent
proteins
one
could
not
conclude
from
the
sequences
alone
that
they
were
related
However
their
appearance
in
the
same
protein
suggests
that
they
arose
via
gene
duplication
and
divergence
The
striking
similarity
of
their
structures
confirms
their
relationship
As
a
cautionary
note
consider
the
proteinases
chymotrypsin
and
subtilisin
They
have
12
identical
residues
in
optimal
alignment
These
enzymes
have
a
common
function
and
a
common
catalytic
triad
see
Fig
85
However
they
have
dissimilar
folding
patterns
and
are
not
related
Their
common
function
and
mechanism
is
an
example
of
convergent
evolution
This
case
serves
as
a
warning
against
special
pleading
for
relationships
between
proteins
with
dissimilar
sequences
on
the
basis
of
similarities
of
function
and
mechanism

How
does
a

make

more

To
be

a

should

of
closely

sequences
If
all
the
sequences
are
very
closely
related
the
information
they
contain
is
largely
redundant
and
few
inferences
can
be
drawn
If
all
the
sequences
are
very
distantly
related
it
will
be
difficult
to
construct
an
accurate
alignment
unless
all
the
structures
are
available
and
in
such
cases
the
quality
of
the
results
and
the
inferences
they
might
suggest
are

one
has

Applications
of
multiple
sequence
alignments
and
database
searching
Searching
in
databases
for
homologues
of
known
proteins
is
a
central
theme
of
bioinformatics
Indeed
it
brooked
no
delay
we
introduced
it
in
Chapter
1
with
the
application
of
PSIBLAST
We
reconsider
database
searching
here
with
the
goal
of
trying
to
understand
how
we
can
best
use
available
information
to
build
effective
procedures
The
goals
are
high
sensitivity
picking
up
even
very
distant
relationshipsand
high
selectivity
minimizing
the
number
of
sequences
reported
that
are
not
true
homologues
Here
we
discuss
how
to
apply
multiple
sequence
alignments
to
this
problem
In
Chapter
6
we
shall
discuss
how
to
apply
structural
information
in
addition
Great
progress
has
been
made
during
the
last
decade
in
devising
methods
for
applying
multiple
sequence
alignments
of
known
proteins
to
identify
related
sequences
in
database
searches
The
results
are
central
to
contemporary
applications
of
bioinformatics
including
the
interpretation
of
genomes
Three
important
methods
are
profiles
PSIBLAST
and
hidden
Markov
models
HMMs
Profiles
Profiles
express
the
patterns
inherent
in
a
multiple
sequence
alignment
of
a
set
of
homologous
sequences
They
have
several
applications
They
permit
greater
accuracy
in
alignments
of
distantly
related
sequences
Sets
of
residues
that
are
highly
conserved
are
likely
to
be
part
of
the
active
site
and
give
clues
to
function
The
conservation
patterns
facilitate
identification
of
other
homologous
sequences
Patterns
in
the
sequences
are
useful
in
classifying
subfamilies
within
a
set
of
homologues
Sets
of
residues
that
show
little
conservation
and
are
subject
to
insertion
and
deletion
are
likely
to
be
in
surface
loops
This
information
has
been
applied
to
vaccine
design
because
such
regions
are
241likely
to
elicit
antibodies
that
will
crossreact
well
with
the
native
structure
Most
structureprediction
methods
are
more
reliable
if
based
on
a
multiple
sequence
alignment
than
on
a
single
sequence
Homology
modelling
for
instance
depends
crucially
on
correct
sequence
alignments
and
can
make
effective
use
of
the
conformational
variation
seen
in
multiple
parent
structures
To
use
profile
patterns
to
identify
homologues
the
basic
idea
is
to
match
the
query
sequences
from
the
database
against
the
sequences
in
the
alignment
table
giving
higher
weight
to
positions
that
are
conserved
than
to
those
that
are
variable
If
a
region
is
absolutely
conserved
such
as
the
WGCPC
motif
in
thioredoxins
the
procedure
should
all
but
insist
on
finding
it
But
the
risk
of
being
too
compulsive
is
to
miss
interesting
distant
relatives
some
leeway
should
be
allowed
What
is
needed
is
a
quantitative
measure
of
conservation
Take
an
inventory
of
the
distribution
of
amino
acids
for
each
position
in
the
table
of
aligned
sequences
For
instance
for
positions
2530
of
the
thioredoxin
alignment
see
Table
52
Table
52
Positiondependent
inventory
of
amino
acids
in
residues
2530
of
16
aligned
thioredoxin
sequences
Given
a
query
sequence
representing
a
potential
thioredoxin
homologue
we
want
to
evaluate
its
similarity
to
the
query
sequence
in
such
a
way
that
agreement
with
the
known
sequences
at
the
absolutely
conserved
positionsfor
instance
26
27
and
29contributes
a
very
high
score
and
disagreement
at
these
positions
contributes
a
very
low
score
For
moderately
conserved
positions
such
as
28
we
want
a
modest
positive
contribution
to
the
score
if
the
query
sequence
has
an
S
or
a
W
at
this
position
and
a
smaller
contribution
if
it
has
T
or
Y
The
general
idea
is
to
score
each
residue
from
the
query
sequence
based
on
the
amino
acid
distribution
at
that
position
in
the
multiple
sequence
alignment
table
It
is
tempting
to
use
the
inventories
as
scores
directly
For
example
if
the
residues
in
a
query
sequence
that
correspond
to
positions
2530
in
thioredoxin
contain
the
sequence
VDFSAE
this
fragment
would
score
13
16
16
6
16
4
71
This
is
almost
the
greatest
value
possible
The
alternative
query
sequence
ACGVAP
would
score
1
0
0
5
16
2
24
a
much
lower
value
Of
course
for
each
query
sequence
we
have
to
test
all
possible
alignments
with
the
multiple
alignment
table
and
take
the
largest
total
score
The
highest
scoring
sequences
best
fit
the
patterns
implicit
in
the
table
This
simple
approach
would
work
if
our
table
contained
a
large
and
unbiased
sample
of
thioredoxin
sequences
But
only
in
that
case
would
the
simple
inventory
give
a
correct
picture
of
the
potential
distributions
of
residues
at
each
position
If
our
sample
were
small
the
pattern
derived
would
be
unlikely
to
reflect
the
complete
repertoire
Or
if
the
sample
contained
a
large
subset
of
similar
sequences
these
would
be
overrepresented
in
the
inventories
For
instance
we
can
see
in
Plate
VI
that
vertebrate
thioredoxins
form
a
very
closely
related
set
If
we
included
20
more
vertebrate
thioredoxins
in
the
alignment
the
profile
would
recognize
only
vertebrate
thioredoxins
242effectively
Substitution
matrices
suggest
how
to
make
the
inventory
fuzzy
and
thereby
more
general
The
observed
amino
acid
distribution
at
any
residue
position
is
a
20membered
array
a
1
a
2
a
3
a
20
where
a
i
is
the
number
of
amino

of
type
i
observed
at
that
position
For
position
25
of
the
thioredoxins
a
1
1
because
one
alanine
is
observed
and
a
18
13
representing
the
valines
Then
in
the
simple
inventory
scoring
scheme
the
score
of
an
alanine
at
position
25
is
just
1
the
score
of
a
valine
is
13
in
general
the
score
of
an
amino
acid
of
type
i
is
a
i
In
this
scheme
the
rows
of
the
inventory
itself
provide
the
arrays
a
needed
for
scoring
each
position
A
better
scoring
scheme
would
evaluate
any
amino
acid
according
to
its
chance
of
being
substituted
for
one
of
the
observed
amino

If
D

score
among
observed
amino
acids
weighted
according
to
the
substitution
probability
An
amino
acid
in
the
query
sequence
could
score
high
either
if
it
appears
frequently
in
the
inventory
at
this
position
or
if
it
has
a
high
probability
of
arising
by
mutation
from
residue
types
that
are
common
at
this
position
This
approach
is
more
effective
in
detection
of
distant
relatives
from
a
limited
set
of
known
sequences
In
this
case
the
scoring
vector
for
amino
acids
at
any
position
is
a
row
in
the
product
of
the
substitution
matrix
and
the
rows
of
the
inventory
array
An
even
better
approach
is
to
use
as
the
amino
acid
distribution
a
combination
of
the
observed
inventory
and
a
general
background
level
of
amino
acid
composition
The
result
is
a
set
of
probability
scores
for
each
amino
acid
or
gap
at
each
position
of
the
alignment
called
a
positionspecific
scoring
matrix
An
alternative
method
of
deriving
a
position
specific
scoring
matrix
based
on
threedimensional
structures
is
described
in
Chapter
6
Given
a
query
sequence
and
the
positionspecific
scoring
matrices
derived
from
a
profile
the
calculations
required
to
find
the
optimal
score
over
all
alignments
of
the
query
sequence
with
the
profile
are
extensions
of
the
dynamicprogramming
methods
for
aligning
two
sequences
A
weakness
of
simple
profiles
is
that
the
multiple
sequence
alignment
must
be
provided
in
advance
and
is
taken
as
fixed
PSIBLAST
and
hidden
Markov
models
gain
power
by
integrating
the
alignment
step
with
the
collection
of
statistics
PSIBLAST
PSIBLAST
is
a
program
that
searches
a
data
bank
for
sequences
similar
to
a
query
sequence
It
is
a
development
of
the
earlier
program
BLAST
The
BLAST
program
and
its
variants
check
each
entry
in
the
data
bank
independently
against
a
query
sequence
PSIBLAST
begins
with
such
a
oneata
time
search
It
then
derives
pattern
information
from
a
multiple
sequence
alignment
of
the
initial
hits
and
reprobes
the
database
using
the
pattern
Then
it
repeats
the
process
finetuning
the
pattern
in
successive
cycles
see
Fig

Schematic
flowchart
of
a
PSIBLAST
calculation
to
detect
protein
sequences
in
a
database
similar
to
a
243probe
sequence
The
user
submits
an
input
sequence
and
chooses
a
protein
sequence
data
bank
to
probe
First
using
the
input
sequence
and
a
standard
substitution
matrix
such
as
BLOSUM62
a
BLAST
calculation
identifies
similar
sequences
in
the
database
and
assigns
a
statistical
measure
of
significance
E
to
each
hit
For
each
sequence
retrieved
from
the
database
E
is
the
number
of
sequences
of
equal
or
higher
similarity
to
the
probe
sequence
that
would
be
expected
to
be
found
in
the
database
just
by
chance
The
program
will
select
those
sequences
for
which
E
is
no
greater
than
a
specified
threshold
often
chosen
as
0005
and
perform
a
multiple
sequence
alignment
of
them
By
counting
the
relative
frequencies
of
different
amino
acids
in
each
column
of
the
multiple
sequence
alignment
the
program
will
derive
a
positionspecific
scoring
matrix
The
box
at
the
lower
left
shows
a
part
of
a
positionspecific
scoring
matrix
The
columns
are
labelled
by
the
20
natural
amino
acids
The
rows
are
labelled
by
the
sequence
to
be
scored
by
the
matrix
In
this
case
the
Nterminal
sequence
of
the
sequence
to
be
scored
is
RDA
The
entries
in
the
column
are
the
logodd
scores
of
finding
any
amino
acid
at
any
position
in
the
multiple
alignment
For
instance
the
entry
under
A
in
row
3
is
1
therefore
the
probability
of
finding
an
A
at
the
third
position
is
proportional
to
10
1
To
find
the
score
of
the
sequence
add
up
the
value
in
the
R
column
of
the
first
row
the
D
column
of
the
second
row
the
A
column
of
the
third
row
etc
to
give
10

10
7
10
1
In
this
example
the
probabilities
are
expressed
unscaled
and
as
logs
to
the
base
10
Note
that
the
sequence
being
scored
may
contain
gaps
This
matrix
can
be
used
as
an
alternative
to
the
input
sequence
and
substitution
matrix
in
a
BLAST
search
Each
subsequent
BLAST
search
based
on
the
matrix
derived
in
the
previous
step
will
return
a
different
set
of
hits
With
a
sensible
choice
of
input
parameters
the
procedure
will
usually
converge
to
produce
a
more
reliable
set
of
similar
sequences
than
would
be
returned
by
the
simple
BLAST
search
of
the
input
sequence
performed
in
the
first
step
The
problem
that
BLAST
was
originally
designed
to
solve
is
that
fullblown
dynamic
programming
methods
are
rather
slow
for
complete
searches
in
a
large
data
bank
Often
the
data
bank
contains
close
matches
to
the
query
sequence
Lesssensitive
but
faster
programs
such
as
BLAST
are
quite
capable
of
identifying
the
close
matches
If
that
is
what
you
want
fine
For
example
if
you
want
to
search
for
homologues
of
a
mouse
protein
in
the
human
genome
the
similarity
is
likely
to
be
high
and
an
approximate
method
likely
to
find
it
But
if
you
want
to
search
for
homologues
of
a
human
protein
in
C
elegans
or
yeast
the
relationship
may
be
more
tenuous
More
sophisticated
slower
methods
may
be
required
It
may
come
as
a
surprise
but
computer
time
requirements
are
still
a
consideration
For
although
computing
is
becoming
less
expensive
the
sizes
of
the
data
banks
and
the
number
of
searches
desired
on
a
worldwide
basis
are
growing
The
net
effect
is
that
the
pressure
on
computing
resources
is
increasing
The
method
used
by
BLAST
goes
back
in
a
sense
to
the
dotplot
approach
checking
for
well
matching
local
regions
For
each
entry
in
the
database
it
checks
for
short
contiguous
regions
that
match
a
short
contiguous
region
in
the
query
sequence
using
a
substitution
scoring
matrix
but
allowing
no
gaps
An
approach
in
which
candidate
regions
of
fixed
length
are
identified
initially
can
be
made
very
fast
by
the
use
of
lookup
tables
Once
BLAST
identifies
a
wellfitting
region
it
tries
to
extend
it
In
some
versions
gaps
are
allowed
The
output
of
BLAST
is
the
set
of
local
segment
matches
In
an
example
from
Chapter
1
even
a
very
simple
algorithm
could
pick
up
all
matching
regions
of
five
contiguous
residues
and
then
combine
and
extend
them
A

until
a
cycle
produces
little
or
no

This
accounts
for
the
Iterated
in
the
title
of
the
PSIBLAST
program
PSIBLAST
using
iterated
pattern
searching
see
the
box
and
Fig
57
is
much
more
powerful
than
simple
pairwise
BLAST
in
picking
up
distant
relationships
PSIBLAST
correctly
identifies
three
times
as
many
homologues
as
BLAST
in
the
region
below
30
sequence
identity
It
is
therefore
a
very
useful
method
for
analysing
whole
genomes
PSIBLAST
was
able
to
match
protein
domains
of
known
structure
to
39
of
the
genes
in
M
genitalium
24
of
the
genes
in
yeast
and
21
of
the
genes
in
C
elegans
The
only
methods
based
entirely
on
sequence
analysis
that
do
better
than
PSIBLAST
are
HMMs
These
are
described
in
the
next
section
To
achieve
significantly
better
performance
it
is
necessary
to
make
explicit
use
of
structural
information
This
is
discussed
in
Chapter
6
See

and

Hidden
Markov
models
A
hidden
Markov
model
HMM
is
a
computational
structure
for
describing
the
subtle
patterns
that
define
families
of
homologous
sequences
HMMs
are
powerful
tools
for
detecting
distant
relatives
and
for
prediction
of
protein
folding
patterns
They
are
the
only
method
based
entirely
on
sequences
that
is
without
explicitly
using
structural
informationcompetitive
with
PSIBLAST
for
identifying
distant
homologues
They
also
perform
well
at
identifying
the
folding
pattern
of
a
protein
from
the
amino
acid
sequence
as
assessed
in
CASP
programmes
Within
an
HMM
is
a
multiple
sequence
alignment
However
HMMs
are
usually
presented
as
procedures
for
generating
sequences
A
conventional
multiple
sequence
alignment
table
could
also
be
used
to
generate
sequences
by
selecting
amino
acids
at
successive
positions
each
amino
acid
being
chosen
from
a
positionspecific
probability
distribution
derived
from
the
profile
But
HMMs
are
more
general
than
profiles
1
they
include
the
possibility
of
introducing
gaps
into
the
generated
sequence
with
position
dependent
gap
penalties
2
application
of
profiles
requires
that
the
multiple
sequence
alignment
be
specified
up
front
the
pattern
statistics
are
then
derived
from
the
alignment
HMMs
carry
out
the
alignment
and
the
assignment
of
probabilities
together
The
internal
structure
of
an
HMM
shows
the
mechanism
for
generating
sequences

and
a

for

Both
of
these
probability
distributions
are
calibrated
to
encode
information
about
a
particular
sequence
family
In
245this
way
the

general
computational
framework
can
be
specialized
to

The
structure
of
an
HMM
Corresponding
to
each
residue
position
in
a
multiple
sequence
alignment
the
HMM
contains
a

and
a

state
d
Insert
states
i
appear
between
residue
positions
and
at
the
beginning

Match
states
emit
a

Here
the
term
match
means
only
that
there
is
some
amino
acid
both
in
the
model
underlying
the
HMM
and
in
the
sequence
emitted
not
that
these
are
necessarily
the
same
amino
acid
The
probability
of
emitting
each
of
the
20
amino
acids
in
each
of
the
match
states
is
a
property
of
the
model
As
with
profiles
the
probabilities
are
positiondependent
Delete
states
skip
a
column
in
the
multiple
sequence
alignment
Arriving
at
a
delete
state
from
a
match
or
insert
state
corresponds
to
gap
opening
and
the
probabilities
of
these
transitions
reflect
a
positionspecific
gapopening
penalty
Arriving
at
a
delete
state
from
a
previous
delete
state
corresponds
to
gap
extension
Insert
states
appear
between
two
successive
positions
in
the
alignment
If
the
system
enters
an
insert
state
a
new
residue
that
does
not
correspond
to
a
position
in
the
alignment
table
appears
in
the
emitted
sequence
An
insert
state
can
be
followed
by
itself
to
insert
more
than
one
residue
The
succession
of
residues
emitted
from
match
and
insert
states
generates
the
output
sequence
After
taking
the
action
appropriate
to
the
type
of
state
m

or

another
probability
distribution
governs
the
choice
of
the

In
every
possible
succession
of

every

of
the

must
be
visited
and
either
matched
or
deleted
there
is
no
way
to
traverse
the
network
without
passing
through
either
an
m
state
or
a

state
at
each
position
The
dynamics
of
the

is
such
that
only
the
current

influences
the

of
its
successor
the

Phylogeny
We
have
now
seen
several
examples
of
evolution
in
proteins
and
in
genomes
These
represent
the
extension
to
the
molecular
level
of
concerns
that
have
occupied
biologists
since
Darwin
and
even
before
The
basic
principle
is
that
the
origin
of
similarity
is
common
ancestry
Although
there
are
exceptions
arising
from
convergent
evolution
or
horizontal
gene
transfer
the
importance
of
this
principle
both
for
rationalizing
contemporary
observations
and
giving
a
window
into
the
history
of
life
cannot
be
underestimated
The
field
of
phylogeny
has
the
goals
of
working
out
the
relationships
among
species
populations
individuals
or
genes
The
general
term
is
taxa
The
observable
taxafor
instance
the
extant
species
for
which
we
wish
to
work
out
the
pattern
of
ancestryare
called
the
operational
taxonomic
units
abbreviated
to
OTUs
Relationship
is
taken
in
the
literal
sense
of
kinship
or
genealogy
that
is
assignment
of
a
scheme
of
descendants
of
a
common
ancestor
see
Box
55
Evolutionary
relationships
give
us
a
glimpse
at
the
historical
development
of
life
see
Box
56
Although
molecules
themselves
cannot
be
dated
the
evolutionary
events
as
observed
on
the
molecular
level
can
be
calibrated
with
the
fossil
record
Box

Concepts
related
to
biological
classification
and
phylogeny
Homology
means
specifically
descent
from
a
common
ancestor
Similarity
is
the
measurement
of
resemblance
or
difference
independent
of
the
source
of
the
resemblance
Similarity
is
observable
in
data
collectable
now
and
involves
no
historical
hypotheses
In
contrast
assertions
of
homology
require
inferences
about
historical
events
which
are
usually
unobservable
Clustering
is
bringing
together
similar
items
distinguishing
classes
of
objects
that
are
more
similar
to
one
another
than
they
are
to
other
objects
outside
the
classes
Most
people
would
agree
about
degrees
of
similarity
but
clustering
is
more
subjective
When
classifying
objects
some
people
prefer
larger
classes
tolerating
wider
variation
others
prefer
smaller
tighter
classes
They
are
called
groupers
or
splitters
Hierarchical
clustering
is
the
formation
of
clusters
of
clusters
of
Phylogeny
is
the
description
of
biological
relationships
usually
expressed
as
a
tree
A
statement
of
phylogeny
among
objects
assumes
homology
and
depends
on
classification
Phylogeny
states
a
topology
of
the
relationships
based
on
classification
according
to
similarity
of
one
or
more
sets
of
characters
or
on
a
model
of
evolutionary
processes
In
many
cases
phylogenetic
relationships
based
on
different
characters
are
consistent
247and
support
one
another
If
different
characters
induce
inconsistent
phylogenetic
relationships
they
are
all
dubious
Note
that
the
same
similarity

of

is
that

Unrooted
tree
of
relationships
among
finches
from
the
Galapagos
and
Cocos
Islands
Darwin
studied
the
Galapagos
finches
in
1835
noting
the
differences
in
the
shapes
of
their
beaks
and
the
correlation
of
beak
shape
with
diet
Finches
that
eat
fruits
have
beaks
like
those
of
parrots
and
finches
that
eat
insects
have
narrow
prying
beaks
These
observations
were
seminal
to
the
development
of
Darwins
ideas
As
early
as
1839
he
wrote
in
The
Voyage
of
the
Beagle
Seeing
this
gradation
and
diversity
of
structure
in
one
small
intimately
related
group
of
birds
one
might
really
fancy
that
from
an
original
paucity
of
birds
in
this
archipelago
one
species
had
been
taken
and
modified
for
different
ends
Such
a
tree
showing
all
descendants
of
a
single
original
ancestral
species
is
said
to
be
rooted
The
root
of
the
tree
typically
appears
at
the
top
or
the
side
botanists
will
have
to
get
used
to
this
Alternatively
we
may
be
able
to
specify
relationships
but
not
order
them
according
to
a
history
The
relationships
among
the
finches
of
the
Galapagos
Islands
studied
by
Darwin
plus
a
related
species
from
the
nearby
Cocos
Island
are
shown
in
an
unrooted
tree

Addition

Statement
of
a

of

may
reveal
only
the
connectivity
or
topology
of
the
tree
in
which
case
the
lengths
of
the
branches
contain
no
information
A
more
ambitious
goal
is
to
show
the
distances
between
taxa
quantitatively
for
instance
to
label
the
branches
with
the
time
since
divergence
from
a
common
ancestor
Determination
of
taxonomic
relationships
from
molecular
properties
Given
a
set
of
data
that
characterize
different
groups
of
organismsfor
example
DNA
or
protein
sequences
or
protein
structures
or
shapes
of
teeth
from
different
species
of
animalshow
can
we
derive
information
about
the
relationships
among
the
organisms
in
which
they
were
observed
It
is
rare
for
species
relationships
and
ancestry
to
be
directly
observable
Evolutionary
trees
determined
from
genetic
data
are
often
based
on
inferences
from
the
patterns
of
similarity
We
generally
assume
that
the
more
similar
the
characters
the
more
closely
related
the
species
although
this
is
a
dangerous
assumption
Nevertheless
from
the
relationships
among
the
characters
we
wish
to
infer
patterns
of
ancestry
the
topology
of
the
phylogenetic
relationships
informally
the
family
tree
To
what
extent
do
the
topologies
of
the
relationships
depend
on
the
choice
of
character
In
249particular
are
there
systematic
discrepancies
between
the
implications
of
molecular
and
palaeontological
analysis
Molecular
approaches
to
phylogeny
developed
against
a
background
of
traditional
taxonomy
based
on
a
variety
of
morphological
characters
embryology
and
for
fossils
information
about
the
geological
context
stratigraphy
The
classical
methods
have
some
advantages
Traditional
taxonomists
have
much
less
restricted
access
to
extinct
organisms
via
the
fossil
record
They
can
date
appearances
and
extinctions
of
species
by
geological
methods
A
crucial
event
in
the
acceptance
of
molecular
methods
occurred
in
1967
when
VM
Sarich
and
AC
Wilson
dated
the
time
of
divergence
of
humans
from
chimpanzees
at
5
mya
based
on
immunological
data
At
that
time
palaeontologists
had
dated
this
split
at
15
mya
and
were
reluctant
to
accept
the
molecular
approach
Reinterpretation
of
the
fossil
record
led
to
acceptance
of
a
more
recent
split
and
broke
the
barrier
to
general
acceptance
of
molecular
methods
It
is
now
generally
accepted
that
human
and
chimpanzee
lineages
diverged
between
6
and
8
mya
Indeed
many
molecular
properties
have
been
used
for
phylogenetic
studies
some
surprisingly
long
ago
Serological
crossreactivity
was
used
from
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
until
superseded
by
direct
use
of
sequences
In
one
of
the
most
premature
scientific
studies
I
know
of
ET
Reichert
and
AP
Brown
published
almost
a
century
ago
a
phylogenetic
analysis
of
fishes
based
on
haemoglobin
crystals
Their
work
was
based
on
Stens
law
1669
which
states
that
although
different
crystals
of
the
same
substance
have
different
dimensionssome
are
big
some
smallthey
have
the
same
interfacial
angles
reflecting
the
similarity
in
microscopic
arrangement
and
packing
of
the
atomic
or
molecular
units
within
the
crystals
Reichert
and
Brown
demonstrated
that
the
interfacial
angles
of
crystals
of
haemoglobins
isolated
from
different
species
showed
patterns
of
similarity
and
divergence
parallel
to
the
species
taxonomic
relationships
Reichert
and
Browns
results
are
replete
with
significant
implications
They
show
that
proteins
have
definite
fixed
shapes
an
idea
by
no
means
recognized
at
the
time
They
imply
that
as
species
progressively
diverge
the
structures
of
their
haemoglobins
also
progressively
diverge
In
1909
no
one
had
a
clue
about
nucleic
acid
or
protein
sequences
In
principle
therefore
the
recognition
of
evolution
of
protein
structures
preceded
by
several
decades
the
idea
of
evolution
of
sequences
Today
DNA
sequences
provide
the
best
measures
of
similarities
among
species
for
phylogenetic
analysis
The
data
are
digital
It
is
even
possible
to
distinguish
selective
from
nonselective
genetic
change
using
the
third
position
in
codons
or
untranslated
regions
such
as
pseudogenes
or
the
ratio
of
synonymous
to
nonsynonymous
codon
substitutions
Many
genes
are
available
for
comparison
This
is
fortunate
because
given
a
set
of
species
to
be
studied
it
is
necessary
to
find
genes
that
vary
at
an
appropriate
rate
Genes
that
remain
almost
constant
among
the
species
of
interest
provide
no
discrimination
of
degrees
of
similarity
Genes
that
vary
too
much
cannot
be
aligned
There
is
an
analogous
situation
in
radioactive
dating
requiring
choice
of
an
isotope
with
a
halflife
of
the
same
general
magnitude
as
the
time
interval
to
be
determined
Fortunately
genes
vary
widely
in
their
rates
of
change
The
mammalian
mitochondrial
genome
a
circular
doublestranded
DNA
molecule
approximately
16
000
bp
long
provides
a
useful
fast
changing
set
of
sequences
for
study
of
evolution
among
closely
related
species
In
contrast
rRNA
sequences
were
used
by
C
Woese
to
identify
the
three
major
kingdoms
Archaea
Bacteria
and
Eukarya
see
Fig
12
Conversely
different
rates
of
change
of
sequences
of
different
genes
can
lead
to
different
and
even
contradictory
results
in
phylogenetic
studies
This
is
especially
true
if
what
we
want
is
not
just
the
topology
of
the
relationships
but
the
branch
lengths
In
addition
horizontal
gene
transfer
and
convergent
evolution
are
competing
phenomenathat
is
competing
with
descentthat
interfere
250with
the
deduction
of
phylogenetic
relationships
One
limitation
of
sequence
methods
is
the
paucity
of
access
to
extinct
species
Some
subfossil
remains
of
species
which
became
extinct
as
recently
as
the
last
century
or
two
have
legible
DNA
including
specimens
of
the
quagga
a
relative
of
the
zebra
and
the
thylacine
Tasmanian
wolf
a
marsupial
and
some
New
Zealand
birds
including
moas
We
have
seen
an
example
of
a
sequence
from
the
mammoth
Extensive
DNA
sequences
from
Neanderthals
have
been
recovered
from
individuals
who
died
approximately
30
000
years
ago
It
has
been
possible
to
sequence
DNA
amplified
from
ancient
samples
given
adequate
preservation
in
continuously
frozen
environments
Most
of
the
samples
that
provide
useful
sequences
come
from
locations
near
the
poles
A
few
are
from
mountaintop
glaciers
even
in
the

of
these

to

or
more
Geologists

ancient
environments

Actual

have
the
potential
to
offer
a
much
sharper
focus

definitely
and

and

probably
These

do
not
characterize
the

of

that

Phylogenetic
trees
We
describe
phylogenetic
relationships
as
trees
In
computer
science
a
tree
is
a
particular
kind
of
graph
A
graph
is
a
structure
containing
nodes
abstract
points
connected
by
edges
represented
as
lines
between
the
points
see
box
entitled
Glossary
of
terms
related
to
graphs
In
a
directed
graph
each
edge
has
a
direction
like
a
oneway
street
A
path
from
one
node
to
another
is
a
consecutive
set
of
edges
beginning
at
one
point
and
ending
at
the
other
like
our
trip
from
Malm
to
Troms
A
connected
graph
is
a
graph
containing
at
least
one
path
between
any
two
nodes
From
these
we
can
define
a
tree
a
connected
graph
in
which
there
is
exactly
one
path
between
every
two
points
A
particular
node
may
be
selected
as
a
root
but
this
is
not
necessary
abstract
trees
may
be
rooted
or
unrooted
see
Fig

Unrooted

the
topology
of

but
not

which
every

has
two
descendants
is
called
a
binary

Another
special
kind
of
graph
is
a
directed
graph
in
which
each
edge
is
a
oneway
street
Examples
include
the
Gene
Ontology
subnetworks
See
Chapter
8
the
HMM
diagram
shown
in
Figure
58
and
the
neural
networks
illustrated
in
Chapter

Rooted
phylogenetic
trees
are
implicitly
directed
graphs
the
ancestordescendant
relationship
implying
the
direction
of
each
edge
It
may
be
possible
to
assign
numbers
to
the
edges
of
a
graph
to
signify
in
some
sense
a
distance
252between
the
nodes
connected
by
the
edges
The
graph
may
then
be
drawn
to
scale
with
the
sizes
of
the
edges
proportional
to
the
assigned
lengths
The
length
of
a
path
through
the
graph
is
the
sum
of
the
edge
lengths
In
phylogenetic
trees
edge
lengths
signify
either
some
measure
of
the
dissimilarity
between
two
species
or
the
length
of
time
since
their
separation
The
assumption
that
differences
between
properties
of
living
species
reflect
their
divergence
times
will
be
true
only
if
the
rates
of
divergence
are
the
same
in
all
branches
of
the
tree
Many
exceptions
are
known
for
instance
among
mammals
rodents
show
for
many
proteins
relatively
fast
evolutionary
rates
See
Weblem
58
Broadly
there
are
two
approaches
to
deriving
phylogenetic
trees
One
approach
makes
no
reference
to
any
historical
model
of
the
relationships
Proceed
by
measuring
a
set
of
distances
between
species
and
generate
the
tree
by
a
hierarchical
clustering
procedure
This
is
called
the
phenetic
approach
The
alternative
the
cladistic
approach
is
to
consider
possible
pathways
of
evolution
infer
the
features
of
the
ancestor
at
each
node
and
choose
an
optimal
tree
according
to
some
model
of
evolutionary
change
Phenetics
is
based
on
similarity
cladistics
is
based
on
genealogy
see
Box
57
Clustering
methods
Phenetic
or
clustering
approaches
to
determination
of
phylogenetic
relationships
are
explicitly
nonhistorical
Indeed
hierarchical
clustering
methods
are
perfectly
capable
of
producing
a
tree
even
in
the
absence
of
evolutionary
relationships
A
department
store
has
goods
clustered
into
sections
according
to
the
type
of
productfor
instance
clothing
or
furnitureand
subclustered
into
more
closely
related
subdepartments
such
as
mens
and
womens
shoes
Mens
and
womens
shoes
have
a
common
ancestor
but
there
is
no
implication
that
shoes
and
furniture
do
A
simple
clustering
procedure
works
as
follows
given
a
set
of
species
determine
for
all
pairs
a
measure
of
the
similarity
or
difference
between
them
This
could
depend
on
a
physical
body
trait
such
as
the
difference
between
the
average
adult
height
of
members
of
two
species
Or
one
could
use
the
number
of
different
bases
in
alignments
of
mitochondrial
DNA
To
create
a
tree
from
the
set
of
dissimilarities
first
choose
the
two
most
closely
related
species
and
insert
a
node
to
represent
their
common
ancestor
Then
replace
the
two
selected
species
by
a
set
containing
both
and
replace
the
distances
from
the
pair
to
the
others
by
the
average
of
the
distances
of
the
two
selected
species
to
the
others
Now
we
have
a
set
of
pairwise
dissimilarities
not
between
individual
species
but
between
sets
of
species
Regard
each
remaining
individual
Example
56
Generation
of
phylogenetic
tree
by
progressive
clustering
Consider
four
species
characterized
by
homologous
sequences
ATCC
ATGC
TTCG
and
TCGG
Taking
the
number
of
differences
as
the
measure
of
dissimilarity
between
each
pair
of
species
use
a
simple
clustering
procedure
to
derive
a
phylogenetic
tree
The
distance
matrix
is
253Because
the
matrix
is
symmetrical
we
need
fill
in
only
the
upper
half
The
smallest
distance
is
1
in
green
between
ATCC
and
ATGC
Therefore
our
first
cluster
is
ATCC
ATGC
The
tree
will
contain
the
fragment
The
reduced
distance

This

of

building
is
called
the
UPGMA

for

with

A
modification
of
the
UPGMA
method
by
N
Saitou
and
M
Nei
called
neighbourjoining
is
designed
to
correct
for
unequal
rates
of

in

branches
of
the

Cladistic
methods
Cladistic
methods
deal
explicitly
with
the
patterns
of
ancestry
implied
by
the
possible
trees
relating
a
set
of
taxa
Their
aim
is
to
select
the
correct
tree
by
utilizing
an
explicit
model
of
the
evolutionary
process
The
most
popular
cladistic
methods
in
molecular
phylogeny
are
the
maximum
parsimony
and
maximum
likelihood
approaches
They
are
specialized
to
sequence
data
starting
from
a
multiple
sequence
alignment
Neither
maximum
parsimony
nor
maximum
likelihood
could
be
applied
to
anatomic
characters
such
as
average
adult
height
The
maximum
parsimony
method
of
W
Fitch
defines
an
optimal
tree
as
the
one
that
postulates
the
fewest
mutations
For
instance
given
species
characterized
by
homologous
sequences
ATCG
ATGG
TCCA
and
TTCA
the
tree
254postulates
four
mutations
An
alternative
tree
postulates
seven
mutations
Note
that
the
second
tree
implies
that
the
GA
mutation
in
the
fourth
position
occurred
twice
independently
The
former
tree
is
optimal
according
to
the
maximum
parsimony
method
because
no
other
tree
involves
fewer
mutations
In
many
cases
several
trees
may
postulate
the
same
number
of
mutations
fewer
than
any
other
tree
For
such
cases
the
maximum
parsimony
approach
does
not
give
a
unique
answer
The
maximum
likelihood
method
assigns
quantitative
probabilities
to
mutational
events
rather
than
merely
counting
them
Like
maximum
parsimony
maximum
likelihood
reconstructs
ancestors
at
all
nodes
of
each
tree
considered
but
it
also
assigns
branch
lengths
based
on
the
probabilities
of
the
mutational
events
postulated
For
each
possible
tree
topology
the
assumed
substitution
rates
are
varied
to
find
the
parameters
that
give
the
highest
likelihood
of
producing
the
observed
sequences
The
optimal
tree
is
the
one
with
the
maximum
likelihood
of
generating
the
observed
data
Both
maximum
parsimony
and
maximum
likelihood
methods
are
superior
to
clustering
techniques
This
has
been
demonstrated
with
cases
where
independent
evidencefor
instance
from
classical
palaeontologyprovides
a
correct
answer
and
also
with
simulated
data
computed
generation
of
evolving
sequences
Reconstruction
of
ancestral
sequences
Maximum
likelihood
methods
of
phylogenetic
tree
construction
determine
as
part
of
their
procedures
the
sequences
expected
in
the
ancestors
of
extant
species
L
Pauling
and
E
Zuckerkandl
suggested
in
a
1963
paper
that
if
we
could
determine
the
sequences
of
proteins
from
extinct
organisms
then
the
proteins
could
be
recreated
by
synthesis
3
In
some
cases
such
a
synthesized
sequence
shows
the
expected
biological
activity
Although
this
does
not
prove
that
it
is
the
correct
ancestral
sequence
the
result
is
of
course
gratifying
Steroid
receptors
are
vertebrate
proteins
that
detect
hormones
including
androgen
oestrogen
progesterone
glucocorticoid
and
mineralocorticoid
receptors
see
Table
53
Upon
activation
they
translocate
from
the
cytoplasm
to
the
nucleus
and
control
gene
expression
They
belong
to
a
larger
superfamily
of
receptors
with
affinity
for
a
wider
variety
of
ligands
including
thyroid
hormones
prostaglandins
and
125dihydroxyvitamin
D
It
is
likely
that
the
entire
superfamily
diverged
from
a
single
ancestral
protein

The
most
primitive

are
lamprey
and

The
receptors
in
these
species
show
high

aldosterone
It
is
likely
that
11deoxycorticosterone
is
the
natural
ligand
of
the
ancestral
homologue
A
gene
duplication
before
the
emergence
of
tetrapods
gave
rise
to
receptors
with
differential
specificity
for
cortisol
and
aldosterone

a

gene
produced
a
protein
that
would
hydroxylate
11deoxycorticosterone
The

see
Fig

Thornton
and
colleagues
computed
the
maximum

evolutionary
tree
of
cortisolspecific
and
aldosteronespecific
receptors
They
inferred
the
ancestral
sequence
and
resurrected
it
following
Pauling
and
Zuckerkandl
synthesizing
the
protein
determining
its
specificity
and
solving
its
crystal
structure
The
computed
and
synthesized
ancestral
protein
is
activated
by
11
deoxycorticosterone
aldosterone
and
with
lower
affinity
cortisol
Thornton
and
colleagues
computed
the
evolutionary
pathway
from
the
computed
ancestral
protein
By
synthesizing
and
assaying
proteins
with
different
substitutions
they
identified
two
mutations
as
primarily
reponsible
for
the
loss
of
aldosterone
affinity
in
tetrapod
glucocorticosteroid
receptors
S106P
and
L111Q
The
L111Q
substitution
by
itself
has
almost
no
effect
on
the
affinity
for
any
of
the
three
ligands
aldosterone
deoxycorticosterone
and
cortisol
The
S106P
substitution
by
itself
largely
destroys
affinity
for
all
three
That
L111Q
is
functional
and
S106P
is
not
suggests
the
scenario
that
L111Q
appeared
first
followed
by
S106P
In
this
way
the
evolutionary
pathway
passed
through
functional
intermediates
only
Other
substitutions
with
less
dramatic
effects
acted
to
tune
the
affinities
to
their
current
value
Molecular
modelling
allowed
inference
of
the
structural
consequences
in
the
computedancestral
protein
structure
of
these
two
mutations
separately
and
together
In
the
hypothetical
glucocorticoid
receptor
of
the
common
ancestor
of
all
jawed
vertebrates
positions
106
and
111
appear
in
a
loop
adjacent
to
a
helix
The
mutation
S106P
on
its
own
is
predicted
to
reconform
the
loop
and
the
adjacent
helix
partially
unwinds
However
a
concomitant
of
these
changes
is
to
bring
position
111
closer
to
the
ligand
to
the
point
where
the
L111Q
mutation
can
form
a
hydrogen
bond
to
the
C17
hydroxyl
of
cortisol
stabilizing
its
binding
This
hydroxyl
is
not
present
in
aldosterone
or
11
deoxycorticosterone
so
the
hydrogen
bond
can
form
only
to
cortisol
Without
the
repositioning
of
position
111
by
the
S106P
mutation
it
is
unlikely
that
the
L111Q
mutation
on
its
own
could
form
the
hydrogen
bond
to
enhance
cortisol
binding

Although
some
aspects
of
this
investigation
are
hypothetical
there
is
reason
to
be
fairly
confident
that
they
are
correct

257The
problem
of
varying
rates
of
evolution
Suppose
that
the
four
speciesA
B
C
and
Dhave
the
phylogenetic
tree
This
tree
is
consistent
with
the
dissimilarity
matrix
Suppose
however
that
species
D
has
changed
very
fast
although
the
phylogeny
is
unaltered
The
dissimilarity
matrix
might
then
be
observed
to
be
From
this
we
would
derive
the
incorrect
phylogenetic
tree
All
the
methods
discussed
here
are
subject
to
errors
of
this
kind
if
the
rates
of
evolutionary
change
vary
along
different
branches
of
the
tree
To
test
for
varying
rates
compare
the
species
under
consideration
with
an
outgroup
a
species
more
distantly
related
to
all
the
species
in
question
than
any
pair
of
them
is
to
each
other
For
instance
if
we
are
studying
species
of
primates
a
nonprimate
mammal
such
as
the
cow
would
be
a
suitable
outgroup
If
the
rates
of
evolution
among
the
primate
species
were
constant
we
should
expect
to
observe
approximately
equal
dissimilarity
measures
between
all
primate
species
and
the
cow
If
this
is
not
observed
the
suggestion
is
that
evolutionary
rates
have
varied
among
the
primates
and
the
character
being
used
may
well
not
provide
the
correct
phylogenetic
tree
Are
trees
the
correct
way
to
present
phylogenetic
relationships
In
the
classic
model
of
evolution
by
descent
and
divergence
the
biological
process
assures
us
that
the
relationship
between
species
is
a
hierarchy
A
tree
structure
is
its
natural
and
proper
representation
The
question
of
whether
we
can
accurately
and
confidently
determine
the
correct
tree
is
a
separate
issue
However
in
some
cases
a
tree
structure
does
not
adequately
account
for
the
data
This
is
observed
particularly
often
in
viral
evolution
or
in
situations
in
which
there
has
been
a
large
amount
of
horizontal
gene
transfer
HJ
Bandelt
and
AWM
Dress
developed
a
more
general
graphical
clustering
method
called
258split
decomposition
that
can
better
account
for
a
set
of
distances
than
a
tree
structure
see

Alternative
representations

Bandelt
and
Dress
consider
the
following
distance
matrix
Application
of
the
UPGMA

tree
representation
Note
that
the
sum
of
the
path
labels
between
B
and
C
is
05

which
is
equal
to
the
BC
distance
in
the
matrix
However
the
sum
of
the
path
labels
between
A
and
D
is
266
266
125
657
which
is
only
approximately
equal
to
7
The
tree
does
not
account
precisely
for
all
the
distance
data
Bandelt
and
Dress
represent
the
distance
matrix
by
a
more
complex
network
based
on
the
split
decomposition
method
This
is
not
a
phylogenetic
tree
such
as
we
are
used
to
But
the
sum
of
the
indices
of
the
edges
linking
any
two
nodes
along
the
shortest
path
does
reproduce
the
distance
data

you

were

Computational
considerations
Cladistic
methodsmaximum
parsimony
and
maximum
likelihoodare
more
accurate
than
simpler
clustering
methods
such
as
UPGMA
but
require
large
amounts
of
computer
time
if
the
number
of
species
is
appreciable
The
total
number
of
possible
trees
which
cladistic
methods
are
committed
to
considering
if
they
could
increases
very
rapidly
with
the
number
of
species
As
a
result
in
many
cases
of
interest
these
methods
can
give
only
approximate
answers
even
with
respect
to
their
intrinsic
assumptions
Because
calculated
phylogenies
are
often
approximations
it
is
important
to
try
to
test
them
Methods
include
the
following

Comparison
of

Formal
statistical
tests
involving
rerunning
the
calculation
on
subsets
of
the
original
data
are
known
as
jackknifing
and
bootstrapping
Jackknifing
is
calculation
with
data
sets
sampled
randomly
from
the
original
data
For
phylogeny
calculations
from
multiple
sequence
alignments
select
different
subsets
of
the
positions
in
the
alignment
and
rerun
the
calculation
Finding
that
each
subset
gives
the
same
phylogenetic
tree
lends
it
credibility
If
each
subset
gives
a
different
tree
none
of
them
is
trustworthy
Bootstrapping
is
similar
to
jackknifing
except
that
the
positions
chosen
at
random
may
include
multiple
copies
of
the
same
position
to
form
data
sets
of
the
same
size
as
the
original
to
preserve
statistical
properties
of
the
sampling

If
there
are

seriously
the

of

in

Putting

all

A
fairly
standard

of

in
bioinformatics
involves
1
selecting
a
sequence
of
interest
and
using
PSIBLAST
or
some
equivalent
tool
to
extract
a
set
of
similar
sequences
2
performing
a
multiple

of
the
sequences
retrieved

from
the
multiple
sequence
alignment
deriving
and
studying
the
conservation
patterns
and
from
the
set
of
overall
similarities
and
differences
among
the
sequences
computing
and
drawing
a
phylogenetic
tree
Some
multiple

alignment
packages
such
as
CLUSTALW
provide
facilities
to
launch
a
phylogenetic

calculation
from
the

they
produce

tools
are

to

the
individual

of
the

Suppose

Define

Instead

pass

by
tipping
each

Dice
are
constructed
so
that
the
sum
of
the

on

Therefore
the

count

Compute
the

Recognize
that
to
go
from
Start

requires
six
steps
including
exactly
three
left
turns
and
three
right
turns
else
you
wont
end
up
at
the
right
place
Different
choices
of
the
order
of
right
and
left
turns
correspond
to
different
paths
To
count
the
number
of
paths
recognize
that
you
need
to
decide
only
how
many
ways
there
are
to
choose
the
three
steps
at
which
you
turn
left
for
then
you
must
turn
right
at
the
other
three
steps
To
assign
three
left
turns
to
six
steps
first
we
can
choose
one
264of
six
steps
for
one
left
turn
then
one
of
the
five
remaining
steps
for
the
next
left
turn
and
then
one
of
the
four
remaining
steps
for
the
final
left
turn
However
the
product
of
these
numbers
overcounts
the
number
of
possibilities
because
it
includes
the
same
sets
of
steps
assigned
in
different
order
Each
triple
can
arise
in
six
different
ways
and
it
is
necessary
to
correct
for
this
The
result
is
equal
to
the

Introduction
To
equip
them
to
play
their
biological
roles
proteins
have
three
profound
and
fundamental
properties
1
for
implementation
of
the
metabolism
growth
architecture
and
regulation
of
cell
and
organism
proteins
show
a
great
variety
of
structures
and
functions
2
for
their
synthesis
proteins
show
a
unity
that
permits
all
proteins
to
be
synthesized
by
one
apparatus
the
ribosome
The
implications
for
molecular
biology
are
analogous
to
the
impact
of
movable
type
on
printing
3
proteins
fold
spontaneously
to
active
native
threedimensional
states
It
is
therefore
sufficient
to
encode
the
amino
acid
sequence
in
terms
of
a
onedimensional
sequence
of
nucleotides
in
a
genome
Evolution
takes
advantage
of
the
hereditary
transmission
of
the
information
and
of
the
mutations
that
generate
variants
on
which
natural
selection
can
act
The
great
variety
of
threedimensional
structures
and
functions
of
proteins
arise
in
molecules
that
share
underlying
common
chemical
features
Proteins
are
like
strings
of
Christmas
tree
lights
almost
all
proteins
consist
of
a
linear
that
is
unbranched
polymer
mainchain
with
different
amino
acid
sidechains
attached
at
regular
intervals
Fig
16
The
wire
linking
the
string
of
lights
corresponds
to
the
repetitive
mainchain
or
backbone
and
the
variable
sequence
of
colours
of
the
lights
corresponds
266to
the
individuality
of
the
sequence
of
sidechains
The
amino
acid
sequence
of
a
protein
is
specified
by
the
nucleotide
sequence
of
a
gene
The
three
dimensional
structures
of
protein
molecules
are
determined
without
further
participation
of
nucleic
acids
by
the
onedimensional
sequences
of
their
amino
acids
Proteins
fold
spontaneously
to
their
native
conformations
How
does
the
amino
acid
sequence
encode
the
threedimensional
structure
Any
possible
folding
of
the
mainchain
places
different
residues
into
contact
The
interactions
of
the
sidechains
and
mainchain
with
one
another
and
with
the
solvent
and
the
restrictions
placed
on
sidechain
mobility
determine
the
relative
stabilities
of
different
conformations
This
is
a
consequence
of
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
which
states
that
systems
at
constant
temperature
and
pressure
find
an
equilibrium
state
that
is
a
compromise
between
comfort
low
enthalpy
H
and
freedom
high
entropy
S
to
give
a
minimum
Gibbs
free
energy
G
H
TS
in
which
T
is
the
absolute
temperature
In
human
relationships
marriage
is
just
such
a
compromise
Proteins
have
evolved
so
that
one
folding
pattern
of
the
mainchain
is
thermodynamically
significantly
better
than
other
conformations
This
is
the
native
state
If
we
could
calculate
sufficiently
accurately
the
energies
and
entropies
of
different
conformations
and
if
we
could
computationally
examine
a
large
enough
set
of
possible
conformations
to
be
sure
of
including
the
correct
one
it
would
be
possible
consistently
to
predict
protein
structures
from
amino
acid
sequences
on
the
basis
of
a
priori
physicochemical
principles
There
has
been
progress
towards
this
goal
but
it
has
not
yet
been
achieved
The
mainchain
of
each
protein
in
its
native
state
describes
a
curve
in
space
We
now
know
100
000
protein
structures
They
show
a
great
variety
of
folding
patterns
The
first
problem
in
analysing
these
structures
is
one
of
presentation
Figure
61
illustrates
the
difficulty
in
interpreting
a
fully
detailed
literal
representation
and
the
kind
of
simplified
pictures
that
computer
programs
produce
to
give
us
visual
access
to
the
material
An
active
cottage
industry
has
produced
many
different
simplified
representations
A
skilled
molecular
illustrator
will
combine
them
to
show
different
parts
of
a
structure

finely
tuned
degrees
of
detail

The

also
contains
four
strands
of
sheet
in
which
the
chain
is
extended
almost
linearly
These
too
are
approximately
vertical
in
orientation
The
four
strands
interact
laterally
to
stabilize
their

a

In

The

the

of
the

the

of
simplification
in
producing
an

of
even
a
small

Protein
stability

folding

the

a
protein
must

To
a
good
approximation
the
mainchain
conformation
of
each
nonglycine
residue
in
a
protein
is
restricted
to
two
discrete
conformational
states
A
fragment
of
the
polypeptide
chain
common
to
all
protein
structures
is
shown
in
Figure

Rotation
is
permitted
around
the
NC
and

single

of
all
residues
with
one
exception

The
angles
and
around
these
bonds
and
the
angle
of
rotation
around
the
peptide
bond
define
the
conformation
of
a
residue
The
peptide
bond
itself
tends
to
be
planar
with
two
allowed
states
trans
180
and
cis

Most
peptide
bonds
in
proteins
are
in
the
trans
state

peptides
are
rare
and
most
cases
involve
a
proline
residue
The
sequence
of

angles
of
all
residues
in
a
protein
defines
the

amino

either

access
to

conformations
In
particular
it
can
form
a

the

a
few
are

and
that
most
of
the

The
allowed
regions
generate
standard
conformations
A
stretch
of
consecutive
residues
in
the
conformation
typically
between
6
and
20
in
native
states
of
globular
proteins
generates
an
helix
Repeating
the
conformation
generates
an
extended
strand
Two
or
more
strands
can
interact
laterally
to
form
sheets
as
in
Fig

Weblems

Helices
and
sheets
are
standard
or
prefabricated
structural
pieces
that
form
components
of
the
conformations
of
most
proteins
They
are
stabilized
by
relatively
weak
interactions
hydrogen
bonds
between
mainchain
atoms
In
some
fibrous
proteins
virtually
all
of
the
residues
belong
to
one
of
these
types
of
structure
wool
contains
helices
and
silk
sheets
Amyloid
fibrils
formed
in
disease
states
by
many
proteins
also
contain
extensive
sheets
269Typical
globular
proteins
contain
several
helix
andor
sheet
regions
connected
by
turns
Usually
the
ends
of
helix
or
strand
regions
appear
on
the
surface
of
a
domain
of
a
protein
structure
They
are
connected
by
turns
or
loops
regions
in
which
the
chain
alters
direction
to
point
back
into
the
structure
Many
but
not
all
turns
are
short
surfaceexposed
regions
that
contain
charged
or
polar
residues
How
does
the
mainchain
choose
among
the
possible
allowed
conformations
What
is
unique
about
each
protein
is
the
sequence
of
its
sidechains
Therefore
interactions
involving
sidechains
must
determine
the
mainchain
conformation
The
sidechains
Sidechains
offer
the
physicochemical
versatility
required
to
generate
all
the
different
folding
patterns
The
sidechains
of
the
20
amino
acids
vary
in
the
following
ways
Size
The
smallest
glycine
consists
of
only
a
hydrogen
atom
one
of
the
largest
phenylalanine
contains
a
benzene
ring
Electric
charge
Some
sidechains
bear
a
net
positive
or
negative
charge
at
normal
pH
Asp
and
Glu
are
negatively
charged
Lys
Arg
and
often
His
are
positively
charged
Charged
residues
of
opposite
sign
can
form
attractive
pairwise
interactions
called
salt
bridges
Polarity
Some
sidechains
are
polar
they
can
form
hydrogen
bonds
to
other
polar
sidechains
or
to
the
mainchain
or
to
water
Other
sidechains
are
electrically
neutral
Some
of
these
contain
chemical
groups
related
to
ordinary
hydrocarbons
such
as
methane
or
benzene
Because
of
the
thermodynamically
unfavourable
interaction
of
hydrocarbons
with
water
these
are
called
hydrophobic
residues
Congregation
of
hydrophobic
residues
in
protein
interiors
predicted
by
WJ
Kauzmann
before
the
first
protein
structures
were
determined
is
an
important
contribution
to
protein
stability
This
effect
is
analogous
to
the
formation
of
droplets
of
oil
in
salad
dressing
See
Box
61
Shape
and
rigidity
The
overall
shape
of
a
sidechain
depends
on
its
chemical
structure
and
on
its
degrees
of
internal
conformational
freedom
Many
pairs
of
amino
acids
have
similar
properties
For
instance
Glu
and
Asp
both
contain

The
hydrophobic
effect
The
difference
among
the
different
amino
acid
sidechains
in
their
preferences
for
aqueous
or
oillike
environments
is
one
of
the
governing
principles
of
protein
structure
What
is
the
hydrophobic
effect
Phase
separation
in
oilwater
mixturesfor
instance
salad
dressingis
one
common
example
another
is
that
gases
unlike
most
solids
are
less
soluble
in
water
as
the
temperature
increases
Readers
with
whistling
tea
kettles
will
have
heard
low
levels
of
sound
prior
to
proper
boiling
this
occurs
when
dissolved
air
comes
out
of
solution
as
the
water
is
heated
What
is
the
origin
of
the
hydrophobic
effect
Cold
water
is
a
highly
structured
liquid
It
contains
many
hydrogen
bonds
which
account
for
its
high
heat
of
vaporization
and
low
density
But
water
is
even
more
highly
ordered
around
solutes
than
in
the
pure
liquid
Methane
dissolved
in
waterit
is
only
slightly
soluble
but
soluble
enough
to
studyis
surrounded
by
a
cage
of
water
molecules
called
a
clathrate
complex
As
a
result
dissolving
methane
in
water
makes
the
solvent
even
more
ordered
lowering
the
entropy
The
natural
tendency
towards
states
of
higher
entropy
inhibits
the
dissolving
of
methane
in
water
This
is
why
methane
and
other
hydrocarbons
are
only
very
slightly
watersoluble
The
solubilities
of
nonpolar
gases
decrease
upon
heating
from
an
already
small
value
in
cold
waterbecause
as
the
temperature
increases
entropy
plays
an
even
more
270important
role
in
determining
the
equilibrium
state
The
hydrophobic
effect
in
aqueous
solutions
of
simple
nonpolar
solutes
was
well
known
to
physical
chemists
when
WJ
Kauzmann
in
1959
recognized
its
importance
for
protein
structure
The
nonpolar
sidechains
of
proteins
are
similar
to
oillike
solutes
Their
interaction
with
water
is
unfavourable
Kauzmann
predicted
that
they
would
be
sequestered
in
protein
interiors
away
from
the
solvent
This
oildrop
model
of
protein
interiors
was
confirmed
by
the
Xray
crystal
structures
of
globular
proteins
We
now
recognize
also
the
importance
of
high
packing
densities
in
protein
interiors
and
that
it
is
better
to
regard
the
interior
of
a
folded
protein
as
more
like
a
crystal
than
like
an
organic
liquid
But
the
hydrophobic
effect
has
lost
none
of
its
significance
As
a
consequence
of
the
hydrophobic
effect
charged
residues
are
largely
excluded
from
protein
interiors
in
rare
cases
they
form
internal
salt
bridges
or
gain
or
lose
protons
to
form
neutral
states
Obviously
the
backbone
must
traverse
the
interiors
of
the
protein
and
carries
with
it
the
polar
N
and
O
atoms
which
interact
with
other
polar
mainchain
atoms
and
with
polar
sidechains
such
as
threonine
or
asparagine
Thus
the
interior
is
not
completely
oillike
Conversely
the
surface
of
a
protein
is
not
exclusively
charged
or
polar
About
half
the
residues
on
the
surface
of
a
protein
are
nonpolar
carboxyl
groups
Leu
and
Ile
are
both
hydrophobic
and
have
the
same
sidechain
volume
Mutations
changing
Glu
Asp
or
Leu
Ile
are
conservative
changes
and
might
be
expected
to
cause
only
minor
changes
in
the
proteins
structure
and
function
A
mutation
from
a
Leu
to
a
Glu
especially
in
a
residue
in
a
protein
interior
would
be
expected
to
do
severe
damage
One
of
the
motivations
for
collecting
SNPs
by
widescale
genetic
screening
is
to
look
for
mutants
that
by
damaging
proteins
cause
disease
However
many
SNPs
associated
with
diseases
appear
in
nonproteincoding
regions

Protein
stability
and
denaturation
What
are
the
chemical
forces
that
stabilize
native
protein
structures
What
is
the
process
by
which
a
protein
folds
from
an
ensemble
of
denatured
conformations
to
a
unique
native
state
To
address
these
questions
biochemists
have
studied
the
denaturation
of
proteins
in
response
to
heat
or
to
increasing
concentrations
of
urea
or
guanidinium

of
the
amount
of
native
and
denatured
states

the

are
kinetic
such
as

of
rates
of

or
unfolding
or
identification
of
structures
that
appear
transiently
during
the
process
One
important
message
from
these
studies
is
that
proteins
are
only
marginally
stable
The
native
state
of
globular
proteins
is
typically
only
20

kJ

more
stable
than
the
denatured
state
This
is
the
equivalent
of
about
one
or
two
waterwater
hydrogen
bonds
Precisely
why
proteins
have
marginal
stability
is
unclear
Some
people
believe
that
it
facilitates
protein
turnover
Others
suggest
that
proteins
are
as
stable
as
they
need
to
be
so
why
bother
less
informally
there
is
no
selective
advantage
in
further
optimizing
the
stabilizing
interactions
We
do
know
that
the
interactions
that
stabilize
native
proteins
are
capable
of
producing
protein
structures
with
much
higher
stabilities
Suppose
you
are
a
globular
protein
in
aqueous
solution
and
you
want
to
achieve
a
stable
native
state
Your
major
problem
is
the
great
loss
of
conformational
freedom
relative
to
the
large
ensemble
of
denatured
states
that
is
exacted
from
you
in
adopting
a
unique
conformation
This
entails
a
large
reduction
in
entropy
which
is
thermodynamically
unfavourable
One
way
in
which
you
can
compensate
is
to
form
a
compact
globular
state
burying
many
residues
in
the
interior
away
from
271contact
with
water
The
release
of
water
from
interaction
with
the
nonpolar
atoms
of
the
protein
produces
a
compensating
favourable
increase
in
entropy
arising
from
the
hydrophobic
effect
See
Box
61
Thats
fine
but
now
you
discover
that
to
form
the
compact
state
you
have
buried
many
polar
atoms
including
but
not
limited
to
mainchain
nitrogen
and
carbonyl
oxygens
In
the
denatured
state
these
atoms
make
hydrogen
bonds
to
water
When
buried
in
the
interior
their
hydrogenbonding
potential
must
somehow
be
satisfied
Dont
forget
one
or
two
uncompensated
hydrogen
bonds
and
youve
blown
it
your
native
state
would
be
unstable
A
fairly
generalpurpose
solution
that
satisfies
mainchain
hydrogenbonding
potential
is
to
form
helices
or
sheets
There
is
a
bonus
formation
of
secondary
structure
also
ensures
that
the
mainchain
is
in
a
stereochemically
acceptable
conformation
as
limited
by
the

Ramachandran
plot
Residues
in
helices
are
all
in
the
conformation
residues
in
strands
of

are
all
in
the
conformation
How
do
you
decide
which
regions
should
form
helices
or
strands
Enthalpically
helix
and
sheet
are
reasonably
similar
for
most
residues
However
entropically
some
sidechains
are
more
hindered
in
helices
than
in
strands
Ile

these
prefer
strands
Such
effects

formation
of

How

be
You

the

is
that

272In
summary
you
have
to
find
a
conformation
of
the
chain
that
simultaneously
solves
all
the
following
problems
1
All
residues
must
have
stereochemically
allowed
conformations
This
applies
to
both
the
mainchain
and
the
sidechains
Steric
collisions
would
raise
the
energy
of
the
conformation
and
render
it
unstable
2
Buried
polar
atoms
must
be
hydrogenbonded
to
other
buried
polar
atoms
If
you
miss
out
a
few
hydrogen
bonds
the
protein
will
prefer
to
form
the
denatured
state
to
allow
these
unsatisfied
polar
atoms
to
hydrogen
bond
to
solvent
3
Enough
hydrophobic
surface
must
be
buried
and
the
interior
must
be
sufficiently
densely
packed
to
provide
thermodynamic
stability
For
most
proteins
there
is
a
unique
solution
of
all
these
problems
defining
the
native
state
Other
proteins
change
conformation
when
they
bind
ligands
or
pass
through
metastable
states
as
part
of
their
mechanisms
of
function
Many
proteins
contain
disordered
regions
The
fact
that
one
conformation
of
a
proteinthe
native
statehas
substantially
greater
stability
than
others
is
complex
but
not
mysterious
It
is
a
question
of
optimizing
the
available
interactions
and
selecting
sequences
for
which
this
optimum
is
unique
and
substantially
lower
than
others
For
most
regions
the
local
structure
is
determined
by
local
interactions
Therefore
if
the
native
state
were
not
unique
there
would
have
to
be
more
than
one
way
to
fit
a
given
set
of
pieces
together
This
is
possible
for
small
independent
subunits
Many
small
inorganic
and
organic
molecules
crystallize
in
different
forms
But
the
constraints
imposed
by
the
connectivity
of
the
polypeptide
chain
make
this
much
more
difficult
for
a
protein
As
a
result
it
is
easy
for
evolution
to
avoid
multiple
stable
conformations
unless
this
is
required
by
the
mechanism
of
biological
activity
Protein
folding
Suppose
again
that
you
are
a
protein
and
that
you
are
denatured
Now
that
you
understand
how
your
native
state
is
stabilized
how
would
you
go
about
finding
it
Clearly
you
cant
try
all
conformations
many
years
ago
C
Levinthal
calculated
that
a
simple
conformational
search
using
reasonable
assumptions
about
speeds
of
internal
rotations
could
not
achieve
the
desired
result
in
times
shorter
by
many
orders
of
magnitude
than
observed
folding
times
Two
circumstances
conspire
to
make
the
process
by
which
proteins
fold
to
their
native
states
a
mysterious
one
First
is
the
fact
that
proteins
are
only
marginally
stable
This
implies
that
any
quasistable
intermediate
in
protein
folding
must
be
even
less
stable
else
the
folding
process
would
get
trapped
in
the
intermediates
Indeed
for
many
proteins
measurements
of
fractions
of
molecules
in
native
and
denatured
states
as
a
function
of
temperature
or
denaturant
concentration
imply
simple
twostate
native
denatured
equilibria
in
which
undetectably
few
molecules
are
anything
but
native
or
denatured
This
confirms
that
there
are
no
intermediates
with
more
than
marginal
stability
But
this
makes
it
difficult
to
follow
the
folding
transition
structurally
The
second
circumstance
that
makes
protein
folding
mysterious
is
that
the
denatured
state
is
so
heterogeneous
that
in
the
absence
of
stable
intermediates
there
is
no
convenient
way
to
visualize
the
complete
pathway
273Contrast
protein
folding
with
two
other
types
of

of

purely
by
the
interactions
between
A
and
B
Were
it
not
for
gravity
a
stable
AB
intermediate
would
be
formed
But
proteins
dont
have
the
luxury
of
forming
stable
intermediates
2
In
assembling
an
arch
from
its
voussoirs
the
structure
as
a
whole
has
no
stability
until
the
keystone
is
inserted
Only
the
completed
arch
has
independent
stability
there
are
no
stable
intermediates
and
the
only
way
to
assemble
the
structure
is
by
using
scaffolding
which
is
subsequently
removed
But
proteins
dont
have
the
luxury
of
using
external
scaffolding
What
proteins
have
to
do
is
to
work
with
unstable
intermediateslike
doityourself

in
the
presence
of
gravityand
to
get
the
job
finished
before
the
intermediates
fall
apart
or
else
keep
reforming
them
and
trying
again
Identification
of
transient
structure
during
protein
folding
can
be
achieved
experimentally
by
isotopeexchange
measurements
Prepare
a
sample
of
denatured
protein
in
which
all
hydrogen
atoms
are
replaced
by
deuterium
It
is
possible
to
separate
signals
from
H
and
D
in
NMR
experiments
At
various
times
during
refolding
in
separate
experiments
expose
the
sample
to
a
pulse
of
protons
After
the
native
state
is
formed
detect
where
in
the
structure
D
H
exchange
occurred
and
when
Such
studies
justify
the
model
that
many
proteins
fold
by
initial
formation
of
a
molten
globule
containing
some
native
secondary
structure
but
without
the
tertiary
structural
interactions
that
lock
the
molecule
into
its
final
conformation
This
is
followed
by
a
hierarchical
condensation
to
form
supersecondary
structure
etc
leading
eventually
to
accretion
of
the
native
state
For
most
proteins
there
is
no
evidence
for
nonnative
structures
as
intermediates
along
productive
folding
pathways
although
nonnative
structuressuch
as
incorrect
proline
isomerscan
divert
and
thereby
slow
down
the
folding
process
The
conclusion
is
that
structures
of
local
regions
are
determined
primarily
by
local
interactions
and
although
these
interactions
may
be
inadequate
to
stabilize
local
regions
to
the
point
where
they
can
be
isolated
they
are
good
enough
to
provide
a
lowenergy
pathway
for
structure
assembly
Most
of
what
we
understand
about
the
process
of
protein
folding
comes
from
measurements
on
purified
proteins
in
dilute
solution
Within
cells
protein
folding
is
made
more
difficult
by
the
intermolecular
crowding
What
is
worse
misfolded
proteins
have
an
enhanced
tendency
to
aggregate
Protein
aggregates
are
implicated
in
many
diseases
including
spongiform
encepalopathies
and
Alzheimers
disease
Cells
contain
chaperones
to
catalyse
proper
folding
and
reduce
aggregation
The
idea
is
that
the
function
of
a
chaperone
is
to
prevent
unwanted
interactions
The
substrates
of
chaperones
are
misfolded
proteins
The
chaperone
recognizes
them
by
the
exposure
of
hydrophobic
surface
The
chaperonin
system
GroEL
and
GroES
engulfs
such
misfolded
proteins
in
a
cage
forming
a
macroclathrate
complex
The
misfolded
proteins
are
unfolded
and
released
to
have
another
try
at
folding
properly
Observe
that
the
chaperonin
does
not
contain
any
information
about
the
native
state
of
any
specific
protein
on
which
it
acts
Therefore
chaperones
are
not
an
exception
to
the
statement
that
all
information
about
the
native
protein
fold
is
contained
in
the
amino
acid
sequence

The
helical
wheel
OB
Ptitsyn
observed
that
helices
in
globular
proteins
often
have
a
hydrophobic
face
turns
inwards
towards
the
protein
interior
and
a
hydrophilic
face
turned
outwards
towards
the
solvent
Each
residue
in
an
helix
appears
at
a
position
100
around
the
circumference
of
the
helix
from
its
predecessor
Therefore
to
achieve
Ptitsyns
effect
the
sequence
of
residues
should
alternate
between
hydrophobic
and
hydrophilic
with
a
periodicity
of
approximately
four
To
check
this
relationship
the
residues
can
be
projected
onto
a
plane
perpendicular
to
a
helix
axis
a
diagram
called
a
helical
wheel
This
example
shows
the
sequence
of
an
helix
of
sperm

myoglobin
Charged

polar
residues
appear
in

others
in

The
helix
has
a
hydrophobic
facewhich
points
to
the
inside
of
the
structure
and
a
hydrophilic
facewhich
points
outside
In
this
picture
the
hydrophilic
face
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
diagram
From
such
a
pattern
of
hydrophobicity
we
can
predict
whether
a
region
of
an
amino
acid
sequence
is
likely
to
form
an
helix
in
the
native
protein
structure

Prediction
of
transmembrane
proteins
and
signal
peptides
Many
proteins
are
designed
to
sit
within
membranes
Membrane
proteins
mediate
the
exchange
of
matter
energy
and
information
between
cell
interiors
organelles
and
surroundings
Examples
of
membrane
protein
functions
include
energy
transduction
via
the
generation
or
release
of
concentration
gradients
across
cell
or
organelle
membranes
and
signal
reception
and
transmission

It
is
estimated
that
in
the
human
genome
approximately
30
of
genes
encode
membrane
proteins
Approximately
70
of
known
targets
of
drugs
are
membrane
proteins
mostly
receptors
Given
that
membrane
proteins
are
so
common
it
is
important
to
have
reliable
tools
for
their
identification
Relatively
few
membrane
protein
structures
have
been
experimentally
determined
Their
identification
and
characterization
places
a
greater
burden
on
computational
tools
for
sequence
analysis
Among
their
adaptations
transmembrane
proteins
contain
regions
of
mostly
nonpolar
residues
which
interact
with
the
organic
layer
Thereby
they
differ
from
watersoluble
proteins
that
show
biases
towards
a
hydrophobic
interior
and
a
hydrophilic
exterior
Most
also
contain
additional
domains
in
the
aqueous
regions
inside
andor
outside
the
membrane
Many
transmembrane
proteins
contain
a
set
of
seven
consecutive
helices
that
traverse
the
membrane
oriented
approximately
279perpendicular
to
the
plane
of
the
membrane
These
helices
are
connected
by
loops
that
protrude
into
the
aqueous
surroundings
A
second
class
of
membraneassociated
protein
structures
contains
a
barrel
Transmembrane
helices
are
typically
1530
residues
long
Although
enriched
in
hydrophobic
residues
they
contain
some
polar
sidechains
usually
in
interfaces
between
helices
packed
together
in
the
structure
A
useful
clue
to
the
orientation
of
the
helices
across
the
membrane
is
the
positiveinside
rule
The
loops
between
helices
lie
either
entirely
inside
or
entirely
outside
the
cell
or
organelle
Those
inside
contain
a
preponderance
of
positively
charged
residues

Superposition
of
structures
and
structural
alignments
Some
aspects
of
sequence
analysis
carry
over
fairly
directly
into
structural
analysis
some
must
be
generalized
and
others
have
no
analogues
at
all
As
in
the
case
of
sequences
a
fundamental
question
in
analysing
structures
is
to
devise
and
compute
a
measure
of
similarity
If
two
molecules
have
very
similar
structures
we
can
imagine
superposing
them
so
that
corresponding
points
are
as
close
together
as
possible
Then
the
average
distance
between
corresponding
points
is
a
measure
of
the
structural
similarity
In
practice
it
is
conventional
to
report
the
rootmeansquare
rms
deviation
of
the
corresponding
atoms
where
d
i
is
the
distance
between
the
i
th
pair
of
atoms
after
optimal
fitting
and
n
is
the
number
of
points
This
assumes
that
we
have
prespecified
the
correspondence
between
the
points
If
the
correspondence
is
not
known
we
must
first
determine
it
and
only
then
calculate
the
rms
deviation
of
the
alignable
substructures
If
each
point
corresponds
to
an
atom
representing
the
successive
residues
of
a
protein
or
nucleic
acid
structure
the
C
atoms
of
proteins
or
the
phosphorus
atoms
of
nucleic
acids
the
problem
is
literally
a
question

Determination
of
similarity
and
alignment
in
computational
chemistry
Three
related
problems
have
applications
in
molecular
biology
1
Similarity
of
two
sets
of
atoms
with
known
correspondences
The
analogue
for
sequences
is
the
Hamming
distance
mismatches
only
2
Similarity
of
two
sets
of
atoms
with
unknown
correspondences
but
for
which
the
molecular
structure
specifically
the
linear
order
of
the
residuesrestricts
the
possibilities
In
the
case
of
proteins
or
nucleic
acids
we
are
limited
to
correspondences
in
which
we
retain
the
order
along
the
chain
with
the
constraint
that
if

then
it
is
necessary
that
i

This
can
be
thought
of
as
corresponding
to
the
Levenshtein
distance
or
to
sequence
alignment
with
gaps
The
result
of
such
a
calculation
is
a
structural

of
parts
of
all
of
the
sequences
3
Similarities
between
two
sets
of
atoms
with
unknown
correspondence
with
no
restrictions
on
the
correspondence
282This
problem
arises
in
the
following
important
case
suppose
two
or
more
molecules
have
similar
biological
effects
such
as
a
common
pharmacological
activity
It
is
often
the
case
that
the
structures
share
a
common
constellation
of
a
relatively
small
subset
of
their
atoms
that
are
responsible
for
the
biological
activity
These
atoms
are
called
a
pharmacophore
The
problem
is
to
identify
them
to
do
so
it
is
useful
to
be
able
to
find
the
maximal
subsets
of
atoms
from
the
two
molecules
that
have
a
similar
structure
via
structural
superposition
of
two
or
more
proteins
is
a
powerful
method
of
sequence
alignment
Because
structure
tends
to
diverge
more
conservatively
than
sequence
during
evolution
structure
alignment
is
a
more
powerful
method
than
pairwise
sequence
alignment
for
detecting
homology
and
aligning
the
sequences
of
distantly
related
proteins
There
are
many
available
programs
for
pairwise
and
multiple
structure
alignment

DALI
and
MUSTANG
As
proteins
evolve
their
structures
change
Among
the
subtle
details
that
evolution
has
strongly
tended
to
conserve
are
the
patterns
of
contacts
between
residues
That
is
if
two
residues
are
in
contact
in
one
protein
the
residues
aligned
with
these
two
in
a
related
protein
are
also
likely
to
be
in
contact
This
is
true
even
in
very
distant
homologues
and
even
if
the
residues
involved
change
in
size
Mutations
that
change
the
sizes
of
packed
buried
residues
produce
adjustments
in
packing
of
the
helices
and
sheets
against
one
another
L
Holm
and
C
Sander
applied
these
observations
to
the
problem
of
structural
alignment
of
proteins
If
the
interresidue
contact
pattern
is
preserved
in
distantly
related
proteins
then
it
should
be
possible
to
identify
distantly
related
proteins
by
detecting
conserved
contact
patterns
Computationally
one
makes
matrices
of
contact
patterns
in
two
proteins
this
is
very
easy
and
then
seeks
the
maximal
matching
submatrices
this
is
hard
Using
carefully
chosen
approximations
Holm
and
Sander
wrote
an
efficient
program
called
DALI
for
Distancematrix
ALIgnment
that
is
now
in
common
use
for
identifying
proteins
with
folding
patterns
similar
to
that
of
a
query
structure
The
program
runs
fast
enough
to
carry
out
routine
screens
of
the
entire
Protein
Data
Bank
for
structures
similar
to
a
newly
determined
structure
and
even
to
perform
a
classification
of
protein
domain
structures
from
an
allagainstall
comparison
Holm
and
Sander
have
found
several
unexpected
similarities
not
detectable
at
the
level
of
pairwise
sequence
alignment
An
example

DALIs

Evolution
of
protein

Included
in
the
100

now

are
several
families
in
which
the
molecules
maintain
the
same
basic

and
S

A
Fig

and
the

deaminasephosphotriesterase
family
Fig
68
are
examples
The
general
response
to
mutation
is
structural
change
It
is
characteristic
of
biological
systems
that
the
objects
we
observe
to
have
a
certain
form
arose
by
evolution
from
related
objects
with
similar
but
not
identical
form
They
must
therefore
be
robust
having
the
freedom
to
tolerate
some
variation
We
can
take
advantage
of
this
robustness
in
our
analysis
by
identifying
and
comparing
related
objects
we
can
distinguish
variable
and
conserved
features
and
thereby
determine
what
is
crucial
to
structure
and
function
Natural
variations
in
families
of
homologous
proteins
that
retain
a
common
function
reveal
how
structures
accommodate
changes
in
amino
acid
sequence
Surface
residues
not
involved
in
function
are
usually
free
to
mutate
Loops
on
the
surface
can
often
accommodate
changes
by
local
refolding
Mutations
that
change
the
volumes
of
buried
residues
generally
do
not
change
the
conformations
of
individual
helices
or
sheets
but
produce
distortions
of
their
spatial
assembly
The
nature
of
the
forces
that
stabilize
protein
structures
sets
general
limitations
on
these
conformational
changes
Particular
constraints
derived
from
function
vary
from
case
to
case
Families
of
related
proteins
tend
to
retain
common
folding
patterns
However
although
the
general
folding
pattern
is
preserved
there
are
distortions
which
increase
as
the
amino
acid
sequences
progressively
diverge
These
distortions
are
not
uniformly
distributed
throughout
the
structure
Usually
a
large
central
core
of
the
structure
retains
the
same
qualitative
fold
and
other
parts
of
the
structure
change
conformation
more
radically
As
a
simple
analogy
consider
the
letters
B
and
R
As
structures
they
have
a
common
core
which
corresponds
to
the
letter
P
Outside
the
common
core
they
differ

the

B

d
only
the
wellfitting
core
The
main
secondary
structural
elements
of
these
proteins
are
two
sheets
packed
facetoface
It
is
seen
in
the
superposition
that
several
strands
of
sheet
are
conserved
but
displaced
and
that
the
helix
at
the
right
of
cucumber
stellacyanin
has
no
counterpart
in
the
spinach
plastocyanin
structure
Even
the
relatively
wellfitting
core
shows
the
conservation
of
folding
topology
but
nevertheless
reveals
considerable
distortion
Systematic
studies
of
the
structural
differences
between
pairs
of
related
proteins
have
defined
a
quantitative
relationship
between
the
divergence
of
the
amino
acid
sequences
of
the
core
of
a
family
of
structures
and
the
divergence
of
structure
As
the
sequence
diverges
there
are
progressively
increasing
distortions
in
the
mainchain
conformation
and
the
fraction
of
the
residues
in
the
core
usually
decreases
Until
the
fraction
of
identical
residues
in
the
sequence
drops
below
about
4050
these
effects
are
relatively
modest
Almost
all
the
structure
remains
in
the
core
and
the
deformation
of
the
mainchain
atoms
is
on
average
no
more
than
10
With
increasing
sequence
divergence
in
most
cases
some
regions
refold
entirely
reducing
the
size
of
the
core
and
the
distortions
of
the
residues
remaining
within
the
core
increase
in
magnitude
A
correlation
between
the
divergence
of
sequence
and
structure
applies
to
all
families
of
proteins
Figure

the
changes

The

from
many

Those

the
changes
in
the

The

of

can

in
some
cases
the

The

that

Some

on

others
are

based
on

of

A

of

Nature

that
computes

from

All
the
information
needed
to
do
this
computation
is

We
do
Many
of
the
most
effective
methods
for
protein
structure
prediction
make
use
of
known
structures
of
homologous
proteins
Indeed
the
degree
of
sequence
similarity
between
a
protein
of
unknown
structure
and
its
nearest
homologue
of
known
structure
controls
what
we
can
achieve
in
prediction
of
the
unknown
structure
and
dictates
what
methods
to
use
Generally
speaking
1
If
a
protein
of
unknown
structure
has
homologues
of
known
structure
with
40
or
more
identical
residues
in
an
optimal
alignment
homology
modelling
methods
are
likely
to
produce
a
nearly
complete
structural
model
The
quality
of
the
model
is
likely
to
be
good
enough
to
interpret
the
proteins
function
The
higher
the
sequence
similarity
the
more
accurate
the
model
Mature
software
for
homology
modelling
is
available
2
If
no
homologue
of
known
structure
has
sequence
similarity
to
the
unknown
with
40
or
more
residue
identity
it
may
still
be
possible
to
assign
a
general
folding
pattern
to
the
protein
of
unknown
structure
It
should
be
possible
to
predict
its
secondary
structure
with
7080
accuracy
on
a
residuebyresidue
basis
Many
servers
will
apply
a
variety
of
methods
to
a
submitted
sequence
3
If
no
homologue
of
known
structure
is
recognizable
from
the
sequences
the
last
recourse
is
to
use
a
prediction
method
general
enough
to
handle
novel
folds
Such
methods
include
both
a
priori
and
knowledge
based
approaches
At
present
the
program
ROBETTA
by
D
Baker
and
colleagues
is
the
most
effective
tool
for
protein
structure
prediction
whenever

is

minimum
of

conformational
energy
function
So
far
this
approach
has
not
succeeded
partly
because
of
the
inadequacy
of
the
energy
function
partly
because
the
minimization
algorithms
tend
to
get
trapped
in
local
minima
and
partly
because
the
calculations
require
more
computer
resources
than
are
available
Other
a
priori
approaches
to
structure
prediction
are
based
on
attempts
to
simplify
the
problem
to
288capture
the
essentials
somehow
There
is
a
spectrum
of
approaches
distributed
between
two
extremes
1
Establish
the
most
detailed
and
accurate
model
of
the
interatomic
interactions
within
a
protein
and
between
protein
and
solvent
Apply
molecular
dynamics
to
simulate
the
motion
of
the
system
starting
with
a
denatured
conformationperhaps
the
extended
chainand
ending
with
something
in
the
vicinity
of
the
native
state
The
idea
is
that
the
physics
of
the
problem
is
fairly
well
understood
down
to
the
detailed
microscopic
level
The
challenges
are
computational
how
to
simulate
the
system
for
long
enough
to
attain
the
native
state
2
Establish
the
least
detailed
and
least
accurate
model
that
can
give
the
correct
answer
If
one
could
identify
the
essentials
great
computational
power
might
not
be
needed
The
idea
is
that
the
physics
of
the
problem
is
not
well
understood
except
in
microscopic
detail
Of
course
everyone
accepts
the
principles
of
mechanics
and
thermodynamics
but
much
of
the
detail
is
irrelevant
and
unilluminating
and
this
is
a
crucial
part
of
the
picture
Proteins
just
arent
that
fussy
at
the
melting
temperature
half
the
molecules
are
in
the
native
state
despite
the
very
great
alteration
in
the
relative
strengths
of
various
terms
in
the
free
energy
relative
to
normal
physiological
conditions
This
argues
for
a
great
robustness
in
the
determinants
of
structure
which
is
difficult
to
capture
in
detailed
calculations
or
to
explain
even
if
they
were
captured
It
argues
for
a
distinction
between
determinants
of
structure
and
determinants
of
stability
also
difficult
to
explain
from
detailed
calculations
In
addition
many
proteins
with
substantial
sequence
differences
fold
to
very
similar
native
states
However
in
some
cases
there
are
large
perturbations
of
the
folding
pathway
The
field
contains
many
people
widely
scattered
between
these
endpoints
linked
by
a
certain
creative
tension
It
is
partly
a
question
of
choosing
goals
To
go
beyond
a
prediction
of
the
native
state
to
account
for
trajectories
transition
states
intermediates
if
any
and
melting
temperatures
a
detailed
simulation
may
well
be
necessary
If
one
wants
a
perspicuous
and
satisfying
explanation
of
how
amino
acid
sequence
determines
protein
structure
then
even
a
successful
fully
detailed
calculation
may
not
provide
it
A
proponent
of
molecular
dynamics
might
argue
that
1
from
a
successful
fully
detailed
calculation
one
could
generate
a
series
of
simplified
models
by
making
approximations
that
keep
the
broad
picture
intact
and
2
a
simplified
model
that
works
isby
virtue
of
its
successinteresting
but
may
be
unrealistic
or
even
if
realistic
incomplete
After
all
there
may
be
many
simplified
models
all
of
which
work
but
which
do
not
agree
on
what
is
essential
The
reason
for
suspecting
that
this
may
be
true
is
the
observation
that
folded
proteins
solve
many
problems
at
once
stereochemistry
packing
hydrogen
bonding
entropy
compensation
It
might
be
possible
to
base
a
successful
prediction
on
optimizing
one
of
these
features
while
ignoring
the
others
any
spoke
may
lead
to
the
hub
The
alternative
to
a
priori
methods
are
approaches
based
on
assembling
clues
to
the
structure
of
a
target
sequence
by
finding
similarities
to
known
structures
These
empirical
or
knowledgebased
methods
have
become
very
powerful
We
are
coming
closer
and
closer
to
saturating
the
set
of
possible
folds
with
known
structures
This
is
the
stated
goal
of
structural
genomics
projects
see
Box
67
Once
we
have
a
complete
set
of
folds
and
sequences
and
powerful
methods
for
relating
them
empirical
methods
will
provide
pragmatic
solutions
of
many
problems
What
will
be
the
effect
of
this
on
attempts
to
predict
protein
structure
a
priori
The
intellectual
appeal
of
the
problem
will
still
be
there
nature
folds
proteins
without
289searching
databases
Moreover
some
methods
may
not
merely
identify
the
native
conformation
but
illuminate
folding
pathways
But
it
is
unlikely
that
the
problem
will
continue
to
command
interest
of
the
same
intensity
and
support
of
the
same
largesse
once
a
pragmatic
solution
has
been
found

If
the

of
the

does
not
occur
in

such
a
method
should
recognize
this
The
results
are
a
nomination
of
a

that
has
the

that

also
The

is
intended
to

the
correct

but
would
not
be
expected
to
be

Structural
genomics
In
analogy
with
fullgenome
sequencing
projects
structural
genomics
has
the
commitment
to
deliver
the
structures
of
the
complete
protein
repertoire
Xray
crystallographic
and
NMR
experiments
will
solve
a
dense
set
of
proteins
such
that
all
proteins
are
within

of
one
or
more
known
experimental
structures
More
so
than
genomic
sequencing
projects
structural
genomics
projects
combine
results
from
different
organisms
The
human
proteome
is
of
course
of
special
interest
as
are
proteins
unique
to
infectious
microorganisms
The
goals
of
structural
genomics
have
become
feasible
partly
by
advances
in
experimental
techniques
which
make
highthroughput
structure
determination
possible
and
partly
by
advances
in
our
understanding
of
protein
structures
which
define
reasonable
general
goals
for
the
experimental
work
and
suggest
specific
targets
The
theory
and
practice
of
homology
modelling
suggests
that
at
least
30
sequence
identity
between
target
and
some
experimental
structure
is
necessary
This
means
that
experimental
structure
determinations
will
be
required
for
an
exemplar
of
every
sequence
family
including
many
that
share
the
same
basic
folding
pattern

2year
cycle
Every

years
the

in
the

At

Protein
structure
predictions
in
CASP
have
traditionally
fallen
into
three
main
categories
1
comparative
modelling
in
effect
homology
modelling
2
fold
recognition
and
3
modelling
of
novel
folds

is
to

requires
either
a
genuine
a

or
a

method
that
can
combine

of
several
structures
Three
groups
of
assessors
one
for
each
category
compared
the
predicted
and
experimental
structures
and
judged
the
predictions
Speakers
at
the
endofyear
meeting
include
the
organizers
the
assessors
and
selected
predictors
including
those
who
have
been
particularly
successful
or
who
have
an
interesting
novel
method
to
present
As
the
field
has
progressed
the
prediction
challenges
have
varied
Secondary
structure
prediction
was
dropped
a
decade
ago
when
specialized
methods
ceased
to
make
robust
progress
Fold
recognition
has
been
dropped
as
a
priori
methods
did
as
well
as
specialized
ones
The
classical
problems
still
provide
essential
background
to
understanding
the
state
of
the
art
and
we
will
continue
to
discuss
them
Currently
the
categories
for
CASP

are
templatebased

The
latest
CASP
programme
took
place
in
2012
There
were
over
100
targets
In
all
categories
213
groups
of
predictors
and
69
servers
submitted
a
total
of
66
297
models
This
was
almost
equal
to
the
number
of
entries
in
the
PDB
Many
predictions
are
prepared
by
groups
of
researchers
who
study
the
results
generated
by
their
computer
programs
and
select
and
edit
them
before
submission
In
addition
the
target
sequences
are
sent
to
web
servers
that
return
predictions
without
human
intervention
The
CAFASP
or
Critical
Assessment
of
Fully
Automated
Structure
Prediction
programme
monitors
the
quality
of
these
predictions
It
is
thereby
possible
to
determine
to
what
extent
successful
procedures
could
be
made
fully
automatic
There
are
three
challenges
Human
against
protein
CASP
Computer
against
protein
CAFASP
Human
against
computer
CASP
versus
CAFASP
A
separate
programme
of
blind
tests
of
prediction
evaluates
methods
for
predicting
protein
protein
interactions
or
docking
This
is
CAPRI
or
Critical
Assessment
of
PRedicted
Interactions
Both
CASP
and
CAPRI
held
assessment
meetings
in
20122013
Structure
predictions
at
recent
CASP
programmes
have
showed
continued
improvements
Indeed
improvements
in
knowledgebased
methods
originally
developed
for
prediction
of
novel
folds
threaten
to
supersede
traditional
methods
for
fold
recognition
such
as
threading
that
make
explicit
reference
to
libraries
of
complete
structures
For
the
most
part
progress
has
been
incremental
rather
than
spectacular
with
one
notable
exception
David
Bakers
group
predicted
and
refined
the
structure
of
a
small
70residue
protein
from
Thermus
thermophilus
producing
a
model
that
deviated
by
159
from
the
Xray
structure
Results
at
CAPRI
show
that
complexes
between
partners
that
do
not
undergo
major
conformational
changes
can
now
be
predicted
from
the
structures
of
the
components
Large
conformational
changes
upon
complex
formation
still
present
difficulties
However
progress
could
be
seen
in
at
least
one
case
the
trimeric
TBE
envelope
protein
For
both
CASP
and
CAPRI
the
best
results
are
very
impressive
An
observer
of
this
scene
once
commented
some
years
ago
that
protein
structure
prediction
had
advanced
to
the
point
that
failure
can
no
longer
be
guaranteed
Things
are
now
much
better
than
that
However
consistency
in
quality
of
prediction
is
still
the
challenge
Secondary
structure
prediction
It
seems
obvious
that
1
it
should
be
easier
to
predict
secondary
structure
than
tertiary
structure
and
2
to
predict
tertiary
structure
a
sensible
way
to
proceed
would
be
first
to
predict
the
helices
and
strands
of
sheet
and
then
to
assemble
them
Whether
or
not
these
propositions
are
correct
many
people
have
believed
in
and
acted
upon
them
Given
the
amino
acid
sequence
of
a
protein
of
292unknown
structure
they
produce
secondary
structure
predictions
the
assignment
of
regions
in
the
sequence
as
helices
or
strands
of
sheet
To
assess
the
quality
of
a
secondary
structure
prediction
classify
the
residues
in
the
experimental
threedimensional
structure
into
three
categories
helix
H
strand
E
extended
and
other
The
percentage
of
residues
predicted
correctly

by
the

at

The
most
powerful
methods
of
secondary
structure
prediction
are
based
on
artificial
neural
networks
Artificial
neural
networks
Artificial
neural
networks
are
a
class
of
general
computational
structures
based
loosely
on
the
anatomy
and
physiology
of
biological
nervous
systems
They
have
been
applied
successfully
to
a
wide
variety
of
pattern
recognition
classification
and
decision
problems
293A
single
neuron
in
the
computational
scheme
is
a
node
in
a
directed
graph
with
one
or
more
entering
connections
designated
as
input
and
a
single
leaving
connection
called
the
output
In
the
physiological
metaphor
one
says
that
the
neuron
fired
if
the
output
is
1
and
that
the
neuron
didnt
fire
if
the
output
is
0
Simulated
neurons
can
differ
in
the
number
of
input
and
output
connections
and
in
the
formula
for
deciding
whether
to
fire
see
Box
68
To
form
a
network
assemble
several
neurons
and
connect
the
outputs
of
some
to
the
inputs
of
others
Some
nodes
contain
connections
that
provide
input
to
the
entire
network
some
deliver
output
information
from
the
network
to
the
outside
world
and
others
that
do
not
interact
directly
with
the
outside
are
called
hidden
layers
An
unlimited
degree
of
complexity
is
available
by
assembling
and
connecting
neurons
and
by
varying
Box
68
Logic
of
neural
networks
For
a
single
neuron
a
discrete
decision
process
governing
the
output
has
a
geometric
interpretation
in
terms
of
lines
and
planes
The
neuron
in
the
following
figure
has
two
inputs
If
we
interpret
the
inputs
as
the
coordinates
of
a
point
x
y
in
the
plane
the
neuron
decides
on
which
side
of
a
line
the
input
point
lies
The
output
will
be
1
if
and
only
if
x
y
2
that
is
if
the
point
is
below
and
to
the
left
of
the
line
x
y
2
A
neural
network
is
specified
by
the
topology
of
its
connections
and
the
weights
and
decision
formulas
of
its
nodes
A
network
can
make
more
complex
decisions
than
a
single
neuron
Thus
if
one
neuron
with
two
inputs
can
decide
on
which
side
of
a
line
a
point
lies
three
neurons
can
select
points
that
lie
within
a
triangle
294Neural
networks
are
more
powerful
and
robust
if
the
output
is
a
smoothly
varying
function
of
the
inputs
Such
networks
can
perform
more
general
kinds
of
computations
and
are
better
at
pattern
recognition
Also
for
training
the
network
it
is
useful
if
the
output
is
a
differentiable
function
of
the
parameters
To
this
end
a
sharp
threshold
function
for
the
output
of
a
neuron
is
replaced
by
a
smoothedout
step
or
sigmoidal
function
the
strengths
of
the
connections
That
is
instead
of
taking
a
simple
sum
of
inputs
i

i
2
i

take
a
weighted
sumfor

i
3
which
would
make
the
neuron
most
sensitive
to
input
1
and
least
sensitive
to
input
3
Biologically
this
may
correspond
to
changing
the
strengths
of
synapses
A
property
of
a
neural
network
that
gives
it
great
power
is
that
the
weights
may
be
regarded
as
variables
and
a
calculation
or
learning
process
may
determine
the
weights
appropriate
for
a
particular
decision
or
pattern
identifier
To
train
a
network
feed
the
system
sets
of
sample
input
for
which
the
desired
output
is
known
and
compare
the
output
with
the
correct
answer
If
the
observed
output
differs
from
the
desired
one
adjust
the
parameters
The
topology
of
the
network
remains
invariant
during
the
training
process
although
of
course
setting
a
weight
to
0
has
the
effect
of
detaching
an
input
The
type
of
neural
network
that
has
been
applied
to
secondary
structure
prediction
is
shown
in
Figure
612
295Figure
612
A
neural
network
applicable
to
secondary
structure
prediction
contains
three
layers
1
The
input
layer
sees
a
sliding
15residue
window
in
the
sequence
That
is
it
treats
a
15residue
region
predicts
the
secondary
structure
of
the
central
residue
marked
by
an
arrow
at
the
top
and
then
moves
the
window
one
residue
along
the
amino
acid
sequence
and
repeats
the
process
To
each
of
the
15
residues
in
the
current
window
there
correspond
20
nodes
in
the
input
layer
of
the
network
one
of
which
will
be
triggered
according
to
the
amino
acid
in
that
position
2
A
hidden
layer
of
100
units
connects
the
input
with
the
output
Each
node
of
the
hidden
layer
is
connected
to
all
input
and
output
units
not
all
the
connections
are
shown
3
The
output
layer
consists
of
only
three
nodes
that
signify
prediction
that
the
central
residue
in
the
window
be
in
a
helix
strand
or
other
conformation
A
major
advance
in
secondary
structure
prediction
occurred
with
the
application
of
evolutionary
information
the
recognition
that
multiple
sequence
alignment
tables
contain
much
more
information
than
individual
sequences
The
conservation
of
secondary
structure
among
related
proteins
means
that
the
sequencestructure
correlations
are
much
more
robust
when
a
family
as
a
whole
is
taken
into
account
Most
neural
networkbased
methods
for
secondary
structure
prediction
now
feed
the
input
layer
not
simply
with
the
identities
of
the
amino
acid
at
successive
positions
but
with
a
profile
derived
from
a
multiple
sequence
alignment
It
has
also
proved
useful
to
run
two
neural
networks
in
tandem
to
make
use
of
observed
correlations
among
conformations
of
residues
at
neighbouring
positions
Predictions
of
the
states
of
several
successive
residues
by
one
network
similar
to
the
one
shown
in
Figure
612
are
combined
by
a
second
network
into
a
final
prediction
A
test
of
the
maturity
of
a
prediction
method
is
whether
it
can
be
made
fully
automatic
See
the
section
on
CASP
Some
computational
methods
require
human
intervention
and
editing
of
results
Others
including
PROF
the
system
that
predicted
the
secondary
structure
of
MutS
are
fully
automatic
Homology
modelling
Model
building
by
homology
is
a
useful
technique
for
predicting
the
structure
of
a
target
protein
of
known
sequence
when
the
target
protein
is
related
to
at
least
one
other
protein
of
known
sequence
and
structure
If
the
proteins
are
closely
related
the
known
protein
structurescalled
the
parents
can
serve
as
the
basis
for
a
model
of
the
target
Although
the
quality
of
the
model
will
depend
on
the
degree
of
similarity
of
the
sequences
it
is
possible
to
estimate
this
quality
before
experimental
testing
see
Fig
610
In
consequence
knowing
how
good
a
model
is
necessary
for
the
intended
application
permits
intelligent
prediction
of
the
probable
success
of
the
exercise
Steps
in
homology
modelling
are
outlined
here
2961
Align
the
amino
acid
sequences
of
the
target
and
the
protein
or
proteins
of
known
structure
It
will
generally
be
observed
that
insertions
and
deletions
lie
in
the
loop
regions
between
helices
and
sheets
2
Determine
mainchain
segments
to
represent
the
regions
containing
insertions
or
deletions
Stitching
these
regions
into
the
mainchain
of
the
known
protein
creates
a
model
for
the
complete
mainchain
of
the
target
protein
3
Replace
the
sidechains
of
residues
that
have
been
mutated
For
residues
that
have
not
mutated
retain
the
sidechain
conformation
Residues
that
have
mutated
tend
to
keep
the
same
sidechain
conformational
angles
and
could
be
modelled
on
this
basis
However
computational
methods
are
now
available
to
search
over
possible
combinations
of
sidechain
conformations
4
Examine
the
modelboth
by
eye
and
by
programsto
detect
any
serious
collisions
between
atoms
Relieve
these
collisions
as
far
as
possible
by
manual
manipulations
5
Refine
the
model
by
limited
energy
minimization
The
role
of
this
step
is
to
fix
up
the
exact
geometrical
relationships
at
places
where
regions
of
mainchain
have
been
joined
together
and
to
allow
the
sidechains
to
wriggle
around
a
bit
to
place
themselves
in
comfortable
positions
The
effect
is
really
only
cosmetic
energy
refinement
will
not
fix
serious
errors
in
such
a
model
To
a
great
extent
this
procedure
produces
what
you
get
for
free
in
that
it
defines
the
model
of
the
protein
of
unknown
structure
by
making
minimal
changes
to
its
known
relatives
In
some
cases
it
is
possible
to
make
substantial
improvements
A
rule
of
thumb
referring
again
to
Fig
610
is
that
if
two
or
more
sequences
have
at
least
4050
identical
amino
acids
in
an
optimal
alignment
of
their
sequences
the
procedure
described
will
produce
a
model
of
sufficient
accuracy
to
be
useful
for
many
applications
If
the
sequences
are
very
distantly
related
neither
the
procedure
described
nor
any
other
currently
available
method
will
produce
a
model
correct
in
detail
to
atomic
resolution
of
the

protein
from
the

of
its

See
Weblem
614
In
most
families
of
proteins
the
structures
contain
relatively
constant
regions
and
more
variable
ones
A
single
parent
structure
will
permit
reasonable
modelling
of
the
conserved
portion
of
the
target
protein
but
may
fail
to
produce
a
satisfactory
model
of
the
variable
portion
From
only
one
target
and
one
parent
sequence
it
will
not
be
easy
to
even
predict
which
are
the
variable
and
constant
regions
A
more
favourable
situation
occurs
when
several
related
proteins
of
known
structure
provide
a
basis
for
modelling
a
target
protein
These
reveal
the
regions
of
constant
and
variable
structure
in
the
family
The
observed
distribution
of
structural
variability
among
the
parents
dictates
an
appropriate
distribution
of
constraints
to
be
applied
to
the
model

These
two
proteins
have
52
identical
residues
in
their
sequence
alignment
With
such
a
close
degree
of
similarity
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
model
fits
the
experimental
result
very
closely
even
with
respect
to
the

that

Fold
recognition
Searching
a
sequence
database
for
a
probe
sequence
and
searching
a
structure
database
with
a
probe
structure
are
problems
with
known
solutions
The
mixed
problemsprobing
a
sequence
database
with
a
structure
or
a
structure
database
with
a
sequenceare
less
straightforward
They
require
a
method
for
evaluating
the
compatibility
of
a
given
sequence
with
a
given
folding
pattern
The
goal
is
to
abstract
the
essence
of
a
set
of
sequences
or
structures
Other
proteins
that
share
the
pattern
are
expected
to
adopt
similar
structures
Threedimensional
profiles
We
have
discussed
patterns
and
profiles
derived
from
multiple
sequence
alignments
and
their
application
to
detection
of
distant
homologues
One
way
to
take
advantage
of
available
structural
information
to
improve
the
power
of
these
methods
is
a
type
of
profile
derived
from
the
available
sequences
and
structures
of
a
family
of
proteins
JU
Bowie
R
Lthy
and
D
Eisenberg
analysed
the
environments
of
each
position
in
known
protein
structures
and
related
them
to
a
set
of
preferences
of
the
20
amino
acids
for
these
structural
contexts
Given
a
protein
structure
classify
the
environment
of
each
amino
acid
in
three
separate
categories
1
its
mainchain
hydrogenbonding
interactions
that
is
its
secondary
structure
2
the
extent
to
which
it
is
buried
within
or
on
the
surface
of
the
protein
structure
3
the
polarnonpolar
nature
of
its
environment
The
secondary
structure
may
be
one
of
three
possibilities
helix
sheet
and
other
A
sidechain
is
considered
buried
if
the
accessible
surface
area
is
less
than
40
2
partially
buried
if
the
accessible
surface
area
is
between
40
and
114
2
and
exposed
if
the
accessible
surface
area
is
greater
than
114
2
The
fraction
of
sidechain
area
covered
by
polar
atoms
is
measured
The
authors
define
six
classes
on
the
basis
of
accessibility
and
polarity
of
the
surroundings
Sidechains
in
each
of
these
six
classes
may
have
any
of
three
types
of
secondary
structure
assignment
helix
sheet
or
neither
This
gives
a
total
of
18
classes
Assigning
each
sidechain
to
one
of
18
categories
makes
it
possible
to
write
a
coded
description
of
298a
protein
structure
as
a
message
in
an
alphabet
of
18
letters
called
a
3D
structure
profile
Algorithms
developed
for
sequence
searches
can
thereby
be
applied
to
sequences
of
encoded
structures
For
example
one
could
try
to
align
two
distantly
related
sequences
by
aligning
their
3D
structure
profiles
rather
than
their
amino
acid
sequences
The
3D
profile
method
translates
protein
structures
into
one
dimensional
probe
or
probeable
objects
that
do
not
explicitly
retain
either
the
sequence
or
structure
of
the
molecules
from
which
they
were
derived
Next
how
can
one
relate
the
3D
structure
profile
to
the
set
of
known
protein
folding
patterns
It
is
clear
that
some
amino
acids
will
be
unhappy
in
certain
kinds
of
sites
for
example
a
charged
sidechain
would
prefer
not
to
be
buried
in
an
entirely
nonpolar
environment
Other
preferences
are
not
so
clearcut
and
it
is
necessary
to
derive
a
preference
table
from
a
statistical
survey
of
a
library
of
wellrefined
protein
structures
Suppose
now
that
we
are
given
a
sequence
and
want
to
evaluate
the
likelihood
that
it
takes
up
say
the
globin
fold
From
the
3D
structure
profile
of
the
known
sperm
whale
myoglobin
structure
we
know
the
environment
class
of
each
position
of
the
sequence
We
must
consider
all
possible
alignments
of
the
sequence
of
the
protein
of
unknown
structure
with
the
3D
structure
profile
of
myoglobin
Consider
a
particular
alignment
and
suppose
that
the
residue
in
the
unknown
sequence
that
corresponds
to
the
first
residue
of
myoglobin
is
phenylalanine
The
environment
class
in
the
3D
structure
profile
of
the
first
residue
of
sperm
whale
myoglobin
is
exposed
no
secondary
structure
One
can
score
the
probability
of
finding
phenylalanine
in
this
structural
environment
class
from
the
table
of
preferences
of
particular
amino
acids
for
this
3D
structure
profile
class
The
fact
that
the
first
residue
of
the
sperm
whale
myoglobin
sequence
is
actually
valine
is
not
used
and
in
fact
that
information
is
not
directly
accessible
to
the
algorithm
Sperm
whale
myoglobin
is
represented
only
by
the
sequence
of
environment
classes
of
its
residues
and
the
preference
table
is
averaged
over
proteins
with
many
different
folding
patterns
Extension
of
this
calculation
to
all
positions
and
to
all
possible
alignments
not
allowing
gaps
within
regions
of
secondary
structure
gives
a
set
of
scores
that
measures
how
well
the
given
unknown
sequence
in
each
possible
alignment
fits
the
sperm
whale
myoglobin
sequencestructure
profile
The
best
score
over
all
tested
alignments
can
be
calibrated
to
decide
whether
the
sequence
and
folding
pattern
are
likely
to
correspond
A
particular
advantage
of
this
method
is
that
it
can
be
automated
with
a
new
sequence
being
scored
against
every
3D
profile
in
the
library
of
known
folds
in
essentially
the
same
way
as
a
new
sequence
is
routinely
screened
against
a
library
of
known
sequences
Use
of
threedimensional
profiles
to
assess
the
quality
of
structures
The
3D
profile
derived
from
a
structure
depends
only
very
indirectly
on
the
amino
acid
sequence
It
is
therefore
meaningful
to
ask
not
only
whether
it
is
possible
to
identify
other
amino
acid
sequences
compatible
with
the
given
fold
but
whether
the
score
of
a
3D
profile
for
its
own
parent
sequence
is
a
measure
of
the
compatibility
of
the
sequence
with
the
structure
Naturally
if
real
sequences
did
not
generally
appear
to
be
compatible
with
their
own
structures
credibility
in
the
method
as
capturing
a
valid
connection
between
sequence
and
structure
would
be
severely
impaired
Two
interesting
results
are
observed
1
protein
structures
determined
correctly
do
fit
their
own
profiles
well
although
other
related
proteins
may
give
higher
scores
The
profile
is
abstracting
properties
of
the
family
not
of
individual
sequences
2
When
a
sequence
does
not
match
a
profile
computed
from
an
experimental
structure
of
that
protein
there
is
likely
to
have
been
an
error
in
the
structure
determination
The
positions
in
the
profile
that
do
not
match
can
identify
the
regions
of
error
299Threading
Threading
is
a
method
for
fold
recognition
Given
a
library
of
known
structures
and
a
sequence
of
a
query
protein
of
unknown
structure
does
the
query
protein
share
a
folding
pattern
with
any
of
the
known
structures
The
fold
library
could
include
some
or
all
of
the
PDB
or
even
hypothetical
folds
The
basic
idea
of
threading
is
to
build
many
rough
models
of
the
query
protein
based
on
each
of
the
known
structures
and
using
different
possible
alignments
of
the
sequences
of
the
known
and
unknown
proteins
This
systematic
exploration
of
the
many
possible
alignments
gives
threading
its
name
imagine
trying
out
all
alignments
by
pulling
the
query
sequence
gently
through
the
three
dimensional
framework
of
any
known
structure
Gaps
must
be
allowed
in
the
alignments
but
if
the
thread
is
thought
of
as
being
sufficiently
elastic
the
metaphor
of
threading
survives
Both
threading
and
homology
modelling
deal
with
the
threedimensional
structure
induced
by
an
alignment
of
the
query
sequence
with
known
structures
of
homologues
Homology
modelling
focuses
on
one
set
of
alignments
and
the
goal
is
a
very
detailed
model
Threading
explores
many
alignments
and
deals
with
only
rough
models
usually
not
even
constructed
explicitly
Homology

identify
homologues
Try
all
possible
folds
Then
determine

alignment
Try

possible
alignments
Optimize

model
Evaluate
many
rough
models
Successful
fold
recognition
by
threading
requires
1
a
method
to
score
the
models
so
that
we
can
select
the
best
one
2
a
method
for
calibrating
the
scores
so
that
we
can
decide
whether
the
bestscoring
model
is
likely
to
be
correct
Several
approaches
to
scoring
have
been
tried
One
of
the
most
effective
is
based
on
empirical
patterns
of
residue
neighbours
as
derived
from
known
structures
First
we
observe
the
distribution
of
interresidue
distances
in
known
protein
structures
for
all
20
20
pairs
of
residue
types
For
each
pair
derive
a
probability
distribution
as
a
function
of
the
separation
in
space
and
in
the
amino
acid
sequence
For
instance
for
the
pair
LeuIle
consider
every
Leu
and
Ile
residue
in
known
structures
and
for
each
LeuIle
pair
record
the
distance
between
their
C
atoms
and
the
difference
in
their
positions
in
the
sequence
Collecting
these
statistics
permits
estimation
of
how
well
the
distributions
observed
in
a
model
agree
with
the
distributions
in
known
structures
The
Boltzmann
equation
relates
probabilities
and
energies
Usual
applications
of
the
Boltzmann
equation
start
from
an
energy
function
and
predict
a
probability
distribution
A
standard
example
is
the
prediction
of
the
density
of
the
atmosphere
as
a
function
of
altitude
from
the
gravitational
potential
energy
function
of
the
air
molecules
For
threading
one
turns
this
on
its
head
and
derives
an
energy
function
from
the
probability
distribution
This
energy
function
is
then
used
to
score
threading
models
For
each
structure
in
the
fold
library
the
procedure
finds
the
assignment
of
residues
that
produces
the
lowest
energy
score
The
most
effective
algorithms
for
finding
optimal
sequence
alignments
are
based
on
a
mathematical
technique
called
dynamic
programming
See
Chapter
5
Although
threading
is
an
alignment
problem
it
cant
be
solved
by
dynamic
programming
because
of
the
nonlocal
interactions

Prediction
of

by

models
Some
foldrecognition
procedures
strive
for
sufficient
generality
to
identify
all
known
domain
structures
Others
are
specialized
to
particular
types
of
folds
The
best
algorithms
for
prediction
of
transmembrane
helices
and
coiled
coils
make
use
of
HMMs
as
will
be
discussed
A
simple
approach
to
prediction
of
membrane
proteins
involves
looking
for
amino
acid
segments
1530
residues
in
length
that
are
rich
in
hydrophobic
residues
However
signal
peptides
also
contain
hydrophobic
helices
the
signal
sequence
typically
comprises
a
positively
charged
nregion
followed
by
a
helical
hydrophobic
hregion
followed
by
a
polar
cregion
Methods
for
recognizing
transmembrane
helices
in
amino
acid
sequences
tend
to
pick
up
the
hregions
of
signal
peptides
as
false
positives
Methods
for
recognizing
signal
peptides
in
amino
acid
sequences
tend
to
pick
up
transmembrane
helices
as
false
positives
Kll
Krogh
and
Sonnhammer
trained
HMMs
to
test
simultaneously
for
transmembrane
helices
and
signal
peptides
The
goals
are
to
find
both
at
the
same
time
to
discriminate
between
them
in
the
results
and
to
predict
not
only
the
positions
of
the
transmembrane
helices
but
the
locations
cytoplasmic
or
interiorof
the
loops
They
called
their
method
PHOBIUS
PHOBIUS
is
the
most
successful
algorithm
currently
available
for
recognizing
signal
peptides
and
helical
transmembrane
proteins
and
for
predicting
the
orientation
of
the
transmembrane
segments
PHOBIUS
is
capable
of
distinguishing
hdomains
of
signal
peptides
from
transmembrane
helices
the
number
of
false
classifications
of
signal
peptides
was
39
and
the
number
of
false
302classifications
of
transmembrane
helices
was
77
These
results
represent
a
substantial
improvement
over
previous
methods
It
is
interesting
that
addressing
the
two
problems
at
once
proved
to
be
more
successful
than
treating
them
separately

Conformational
energy
calculations
and
molecular
dynamics
A
protein
is
a
collection
of
atoms
The
interactions
between
the
atoms
create
a
unique
state
of
maximum
stability
Find
it
thats
all
The
computational
difficulties
in
this
approach
arise
because
1
the
model
of
the
interatomic
interactions
is
not
complete
or
exact
and
2
even
if
the
model
were
exact
we
face
an
optimization
problem
in
a
large
number
of
variables
involving
nonlinearities
in
the
objective
function
and
the
constraints
creating
a
very
rough
energy
surface
with
many
local
minima
Like
a
golf
course
with
many
bunkers
such
problems
are
very
difficult
The
interactions
between
atoms
in
a
molecule
can
be
divided
into
1
primary
chemical
bonds
strong
interactions
between
atoms
that
must
be
close
together
in
space
these
are
regarded
as
a
fixed
set
of
interactions
that
are
not
broken
or
formed
when
the
conformation
of
a
protein
changes
but
are
equally
consistent
with
a
large
number
of
conformations
2
weaker
interactions
that
depend
on
the
conformation
of
the
chain
These
can
be
significant
in
some
conformations
and
not
in
others
they
affect
sets
of
atoms
that
are
brought
into
proximity
by
different
folds
of
the
chain
The
conformation
of
a
protein
can
be
specified
by
giving
the
list
of
atoms
in
the
structure
their
coordinates
and
the
set
of
primary
chemical
bonds
between
them
this
can
be
read
off
with
only
slight
ambiguity
from
the
amino
acid
sequence
Terms

in
the
evaluation
of
the
energy
of
a

is

not
explicitly

of

are
the

R
ij
is
the

them
and
is
the
dielectric
constant
This
formula
applies
only
approximately
to
media
that
are
not
infinite
and
isotropic
including
proteins
Solvent
interactions
with
the
solvent
water
and
cosolutes
such
as
salts
and
sugars
are
crucial
for
the
thermodynamics
of
protein
structures
Attempts
to
model
the
solvent
as
a
continuous
medium
characterized
primarily
by
a
dielectric
constant
are
approximations
With
the
increase
in
available
computer
power
it
is
now
possible
to
include
solvent
explicitly
simulating
the
motion
of
a
protein
in
a
box
of
water
molecules
There
are
numerous
sets
of
conformational
energy
potentials
of
this
or
closely
related
forms
and
a
great
deal
of
effort
has
gone
into
the
tuning
of
parameter
sets
The
energy
of
a
conformation
is
computed
by
summing
these
terms
over
all
bonded
and
nonbonded
atoms
The
potential
functions
satisfy
necessary
but
not
sufficient
conditions
for
successful
structure
prediction
One
test
is
to
take
the
right
answeran
experimentally
determined
protein
structureas
a
starting
conformation
and
minimize
the
energy
starting
from
there
Most
highquality
energy
functions
produce
a
minimized
conformation
that
is
about
1
rms
deviation
away
from
the
starting
model
This
can
be
thought
of
as
a
measure
of
the
resolution
of
the
force
field
Another
test
has
been
to
take
deliberately
misfolded
proteins
and
minimize
their
conformational
energies
to
see
whether
the
energy
value
of
the
local
minimum
in
the
vicinity
of
the
correct
fold
is
significantly
lower
than
that
of
the
local
minimum
in
the
vicinity
of
an
incorrect
fold
Such
tests
reveal
that
multiple
local
minima
cannot
be
reliably
distinguished
from
the
correct
one
on
the
basis
of
calculated
conformational
energies
Indeed
attempts
to
predict
the
conformation
of
a
protein
by
minimization
of
the
conformational
energy
have
so
far
not
provided
a
general
method
for
predicting
protein
structure
from
amino
acid
sequence
Molecular
dynamics
offers
a
way
to
overcome
the
problems
of
getting
trapped
in
local
minima
and
of
the
absence
of
a
good
static
model
for
proteinsolvent
interactions
In
molecular
dynamics
calculations
the
protein
plus
explicit
solvent
molecules
are
treatedvia
the
force
field
by
classical
Newtonian
mechanics
It
is
true
that
this
permits
exploration
of
a
much
larger
sector
of
phase
space
However
as
an
a
priori
method
of
structure
prediction
it
has
still
not
succeeded
consistently
However
these
are
calculations
that
are
extremely
computationally
intensive
and
here
perhaps
more
than
anywhere
else
in
this
field
advances
deriving
from
the
increased
power
of
processors
will
have
an
effect
304Is
lack
of
computational
power
the
only
reason
for
lack
of
success
in
prediction
of
protein
structure
by
simulation
of
the
folding
pathway
There
have
been
several
attempts
to
apply
brute
force
including
the
IBM
Blue
Gene
supercomputer
project
and
the
distributed
computing
approach
of
Folding
which
makes
use
of
contributions
of
computer
power
from
over
a
million
participating
CPUs
A
similar
approach
has
been
applied
to
drug
design
In
2003
an
IBM
group
folded
a
20
residue
peptide
from
a
fully
extended
conformation
to
a
state
within
15
rms
deviation
of
the
native
state
See
Box
69
In
the
meantime
molecular
dynamics
if
supplemented
by
experimental
data
regularly
makes
extremely
important
contributions
to
structure
determinations
by
both
Xray
crystallography
usually
and
NMR
always
How
is
molecular
dynamics
integrated
into
the
process
of
structure
determination
For
any
conformation
one
can
measure
the
consistency
of
the
model
with
the
experimental
data
In
the
case
of
crystallography
the
experimental
data
are
the
absolute
values
of
the
Fourier
transform
of
the
electron
density
of
the
molecule
In
the
case
of
NMR
the
experimental
data
provide
constraints
on
the
distances

Scaling
of
resource
requirements
for
molecular
dynamics
calculations
Fully
detailed
molecular
dynamics
calculations
perform
a
series
of
individual
time
steps
of
duration
10
15
s
1
fs
The
computer
time
required
for
an
individual
time
step
scales
approximately
as
N
ln
N
where
N
is
the
length
of
the
protein
The
time
required
for
a
protein
to
fold
depends
on
a
number
of
features
but
for
purposes
of
a
backoftheenvelope
calculation
it
varies
with
the
length
N
of
the
protein
as
N
23
Therefore
the
total
computer
resources
required
to
fold
a
protein
may
be
expected
to
vary
approximately
as
N
53
ln
N
This
means
that
if
it
takes
3
months
of
uninterrupted
time
on
a
supercomputer
running
flat
out
to
fold
a
protein
of
length
N
it
would
be
expected
to
require
over
15
years
on
the
same
system
to
fold
up
a
protein
of

3
N
residues
between
certain
pairs
of
residues
But
in
both
Xray
crystallography
usually
and
NMR
the
experimental
data
underdetermine
the
protein
structure
To
solve
a
structure
one
must
seek
a
set
of
coordinates
that
minimizes
a
combination
of
the
deviation
from
the
experimental
data
and
the
conformational
energy
Molecular
dynamics
is
successful
at
determining
such
coordinate
sets
the
dynamics
provides
adequate
coverage
of
conformation
space
and
the
bias
derived
from
the
experimental
data
channels
the
calculation
quite
effectively
towards
the
correct
structure
Molecular
dynamics
revolutionized
protein
crystallography
It
has
transformed
what
used
to
be
a
lengthy
labourintensive
process
of
manual
building
and
rebuilding
of
models
into
electron
densities
into
a
batch
job
turned
over
to

ROSETTA
ROSETTA
is
a
program
by
D
Baker
and
colleagues
that
predicts
protein
structure
from
amino
acid
sequence
by
assimilating
information
from
known
structures
At
recent
CASP
programmes
ROSETTA
has
showed
consistent
success
on
targets
in
both
the
Fold
Recognition
and
Novel
Fold
categories
At
present
it
leads
the
field
by
several
lengths
It
represents
a
major
breakthrough
ROSETTA
predicts
a
protein
structure
by
first
generating
structures
of
fragments
using
known
structures
and
then
combining
them
First
for
each
contiguous
region
of
three
and
nine
residues
instances
of
that
sequence
and
related
sequences
are
identified
in
proteins
of
known
structure
For
fragments
this
small
there
is
no
assumption
of
homology
to
the
target
protein
The
distribution
of
305conformations
of
the
fragments
serves
as
a
model
for
the
distribution
of
possible
conformations
of
the
corresponding
fragments
of
the
target
structure
ROSETTA
explores
the
possible
combinations
of
fragments
using
Monte
Carlo
calculations
see
Box

The
energy
function
has
terms

The
procedure
carries
out
1000

simulations
with

Monte

algorithms
Monte
Carlo
algorithms
are
used
very
widely
in
protein
structure
calculations
to
explore
conformations
efficiently
and
in
many
other
optimization
problems
to
search
for
the
minimum
of
a
complicated
function
Simple
minimization
methods
based
on
moving
downhill
in
energy
fail
because
the
calculation
gets
trapped
in
a
local
minimum
far
from
the
native
state
In
general
Monte
Carlo
methods
make
use
of
random
numbers
to
solve
problems
for
which
it
is
difficult
to
calculate
the
answer
exactly
The
name
was
invented
by
J
von
Neumann
referring
to
the
applications
of
randomnumber
generators
in
the
famous
casino
in
Monaco
To
apply
Monte
Carlo
techniques
to
find
the
minimum
of
a
function
of
many
variablesfor
instance
the
minimum
energy
of
a
protein
as
a
function
of
the
variables
that
define
its
conformationsuppose
that
the
configuration
of
the
system
is
specified
by
the
variables
x
and
that
for
any
values
of
these
variables
we
can
calculate
the
energy
of
the
conformation
E
x
x
stands
for
a
whole
set
of
variables
perhaps
the
set
of
atomic
coordinates
of
a
protein
or
the
mainchain
and
sidechain
torsion
angles
Then
the
Metropolis
procedure
invented
in
1953
allegedly
at
a
dinner
party
in
Los
Alamos
prescribes
1
generate
a
random
set
of

that
is
the
ingenious
one
It
has
the
potential
to
get

out
of

in
local

The
effective
temperature
T
controls
the
chance
that
an
uphill
move
will
be
accepted
T
is
not
the
physical
temperature
at
which
we
wish
to
predict
the
protein
conformation
but
simply
a
numerical
parameter
that
controls
the
calculation
For
any
temperature
the
higher
the
uphill
energy
difference
the
less
likely
that
the
step
will
be
accepted
For
any

if

then
E

kT

and
exp

If

then
E

will
be

The
higher
the
temperature
the
more
probable
the
acceptance
of

This
relatively
simple
idea
has
proved
extremely
effective
with
successful
applications
including
but
by
no
means
limited
to
protein
structure
calculations
Simulated

development

Monte

calculations

and
then
it

the

LINUS
LINUS
or
Local
Independently
Nucleated
Units
of
Structure
is
a
program
for
prediction
of
protein
structure
from
amino
acid
sequence
by
GD
Rose
and
R
Srinivasan
It
is
a
completely
a
priori
procedure
making
no
explicit
reference
to
any
known
structures
or
sequencestructure
relationships
LINUS
folds
the
polypeptide
chain
in
a
hierarchical
fashion
first
producing
structures
of
short
segments
and
then
assembling
them
into
progressively
larger
fragments
An
insight
underlying
LINUS
is
that
the
structures
of
local
regions
of
a
proteinshort
segments
of
residues
consecutive
in
the
sequenceare
controlled
by
local
interactions
within
these
segments
During
natural
protein
folding
each
segment
will
preferentially
sample
its
most
favourable
conformations
However
these
preferred
conformations
of
local
regions
even
the
one
that
will
ultimately
be
adopted
in
the
native
state
are
below
the
threshold
of
stability
Local
structure
will
form
transiently
and
break
up
many
times
before
a
suitable
interacting
partner
stabilizes
it
But
in
the
computer
one
is
free
to
anticipate
the
results
In
a
LINUS
simulation
favourable
structures
of
local
fragments
as
determined
by
their
frequent
recurrence
during
the
simulation
transmit
their
preferred
conformations
as
biases
that
influence
subsequent
steps
The
procedure
applies
the
principle
of
a
rachet
to
direct
the
calculation
along
productive
lines
LINUS
begins
by
building
the
polypeptide
from
the
sequence
as
an
extended
chain
The
307simulation
proceeds
by
perturbing
the
conformations
of
a
succession
of
randomly
chosen
three
residue
segments
and
evaluating
the
energies
of
the
results
Structures
with
steric
clashes
are
rejected
out
of
hand
other
energetic
contributions
are
evaluated
only
in
terms
of
local
interactions

is
used
to
decide
whether
to
accept
a
perturbed
structure
or
revert
to
its
predecessor
LINUS
performs
a
large
number
of
such
steps
It
periodically
samples
the
conformations
of
the
residues
to
accumulate
statistics
of
structural
preferences
Subsequent
stages
in
the
simulation
assemble
local
regions
into
larger
fragments
using
the
conformational
biases
of
the
smaller
regions
to
guide
the
process
The
window
within
the
sequence
controlling
the
range
of
interactions
is
progressively
opened
from
short
local
regions
to
larger
ones
and
ultimately
to
the
entire
protein
The
LINUS
representation
of
the
protein
folding
process
is
realistic
in
essential
respects
although
approximate
All
nonhydrogen
atoms
of
a
protein
are
modelled
but
the
energy
function
is
approximate
and
the
dynamics
simplified
The
energy
function
captures
the
ideas
of
1
steric
repulsion
preventing
overlap
of
atoms
2
clustering
of
buried
hydrophobic
residues
3
hydrogen
bonding
and
4
salt
bridges
LINUS
is
generally
successful
in
getting
correct
structures
of
small
fragments
sized
between
a
supersecondary
structure
and
a
domain
and
in
some
cases
can
assemble
them
into
the
right
global
structure

Assignment
of
protein
structures
to
genomes
A
genome
sequence
is
the
complete
statement
of
a
potential
life
Assignment
of
structures
to
gene
products
is
a
first
step
in
understanding
how
organisms
implement
their
genomic
information
We
want
to
understand
the
structures
of
the
molecules
encoded
in
a
genome
their
individual
activities
and
interactions
and
the
organization
of
these
activities
and
interactions
in
space
and
time
during
the
lifetime
of
the
organism
We
want
to
understand
the
relationships
among
the
molecules
encoded
in
the
genome
of
one
individual
and
their
relationships
to
those
of
other
individuals
and
other
species
For
individual
proteins
knowing
their
structure
is
essential
for
understanding
the
mechanism
of
their
function
and
interactions
For
entire
organisms
knowing
the
structures
tells
us
how
the
repertoire
of
possible
protein
folds
is
called
upon
and
how
it
is
distributed
among
different
functional
categories
in
different
species
For
interspecies
comparisons
protein
structures
can
reveal
relationships
invisible
in
highly
diverged
sequences
Several
methods
have
been
applied
to
structure

methods
such
as
PSI
BLAST
or
HMMs
can
identify
relationships
between
proteins
both
within
an
organism
and
between

If
the
structure
of
any
homologue
is
known
experimentally
at
least
the
general
fold
of
the
family
can
be
inferred
Foldrecognition
methods
can
assign
folds
to
some
proteins
even
in
the
absence
of
evidence
for
homology
Specialized
techniques

membrane
proteins
and

coils
The
results
of

provide

of

in
the
different

of
proteins

The
degree

of

Prediction
of
protein

The
cascade
of
inference
should
ideally
flow
as
sequence
structure
function
However
although
we
can
be
confident
that
similar
amino
acid
sequences
will
produce
similar
protein
structures
the
relationship
between
structure
and
function
is
more
complex
Proteins
of
similar
structure
and
even
of
similar
sequence
can
be
recruited
for
very
different
functions
Very
widely
diverged
proteins
may
retain
similar
functions
Moreover
just
as
many
different
sequences
are
compatible
with
the
same
structure
proteins
with
different
folds
can
carry
out
the
same
function

progressively
with
the

conversely
similar

are
often
found
with
very

sequences
In
many
cases
the
relationships
in
a
family
of
proteins
can
be
detected
only
in
the
structures
the
sequences
having
diverged
beyond
the
point
of
our
being
able
to
detect
the
underlying
common
features
similar
sequences
and
structures
often
produce
proteins
with
similar
functions
but
exceptions
abound
conversely
similar
functions
are
often
carried
out
by
nonhomologous
proteins
with
dissimilar
structures
examples
include
the
different
families
of
proteinases
sugar
kinases
and
lysyltRNA
synthetases
As
proteins
evolve
they
may
retain
function
and
specificity
retain
function
but
alter
specificity
change
to
a
related
function
or
a
similar
function
in
a
different

context
or
change
to
a

The
family
of
chymotrypsinlike
serine
proteinases
includes
closely
related
enzymes
in
which
function
is
conserved
and
widely
diverged
homologues
that
have
developed
novel
functions

and

have

Evolutionary
relationships
among
proteins
homologues
orthologues
and
paralogues
Proteins
are
homologous
if
and
only
if
they
are
descended
from
a
common
ancestor
Homologues
in
different
species
descended
from
a
single
ancestral
protein
are
orthologues
Homologues
in
the
same
species
arising
from
gene
duplication
are
paralogues
Their
descendants
are
also
paralogues
After
gene
duplication
one
of
the
resulting
pairs
of
proteins
can
continue
to
provide
its
customary
function
releasing
the
other
to
diverge
to
develop
new
functions
Therefore
inferences
of
function
from
homology
are
more
secure
for
orthologues
than
for
paralogues

Trypsin

function
in
digestion
of
food
Another
set
of
paralogues
mediates
the
blood
coagulation
cascade
Although
all
are
proteinases
the
requirements
for
activation
and
control
are
very
different
for
digestion
and
blood
coagulation
and
the
families
have
diverged
and
become
specialized
for
these
respective
roles
Many
proteolytic
enzymes
are
synthesized
in
inactive
forms
and
mature
by
peptide
cleavage
to
expose
the
active
site
It
would
just
not
do
to
have
rogue
proteases
running
around
in
cells
However
in
trypsin
activation
involves
cleavage
of
a
15residue
Nterminal
peptide
In
the
activation
of
thrombin
the
protein
is
doubly
cleaved
not
near
the
initial
Nterminus
and
ends
up
as
about
half
the
size
of
its
precursor
Also
trypsin
and
thrombin
interact
with
different
sets
of
inhibitors
and
thrombin
but
not
trypsin
is
subject
to
allosteric
control
Some
homologues
of
trypsin
have
developed
entirely
new
functions
as
described
here
Haptoglobin
is
a
chymotrypsin
homologue
that
has
lost
its
proteolytic
activity
It
acts
as
a
chaperone
preventing
unwanted
aggregation
of
proteins
Haptoglobin
forms
a
tight
complex
with
haemoglobin
fragments
released
from
erythrocytes
with
several
useful
effects
including
preventing
the
loss
of
iron
The
serine
proteinase
of
rhinovirus
has
developed
a
separate
independent
function
of
forming
the
initiation
complex
in
RNA
synthesis
using
residues
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
molecule
from
the
active
site
for
proteolysis
This
is
not
a
modification
of
an
active
site
it
is
the
creation
of
a
new
one
Subunits
homologous
to
serine
proteinases
appear
in
plasminogenrelated
growth
factors
The
role
of
these
subunits
in
growth
factor
activity
is
not
yet
known
but
it
cannot
be
a
proteolytic
function
because
essential
catalytic
residues
have
been
lost
An
antifreeze
glycoprotein
in
antarctic
fish
is
homologous
to
chymotrypsin
The
insect
immune
protein
scolexin
is
a
distant
homologue
of
serine
proteinases
that
induces
coagulation
of
haemolymph
in
response
to
infection
In
the
chymotrypsin
family
we
see
a
retention
of
structure
with
similar
functions
in
closely
related
proteins
and
progressive
divergence
of
function
in
some
but
not
all
distantly
related
ones
The
message
is
that
the
overall
folding
pattern
of
a
protein
is
an
unreliable
guide
to
predicting
function
especially
for
very
distant
homologues
For
correct
prediction
of
function
in
distantly
related
proteins
it
is
necessary
to
focus
on
the
active
site
For
example
JF
Bazan
and
R
Fletterick
and
independently
P
Argos
G
Kamer
MJ
Nicklin
and
E
Wimmer
recognized
that
viral
3C
proteinases
are
chymotrypsin
homologues
despite
the
fact
that
the
serine
of
the
catalytic
triad
is
changed
to
cysteine
WR
Taylor
and
L
Pearl
recognized
the
distant
homology
between
retroviral
and
aspartic
proteinases
from
conserved
Asp
Thr
and
Gly
residues
Like
motif
libraries
such
as
PROSITE
such
approaches
go
directly
from
signature
patterns
of
active
site
residues
in
the
sequence
to
conserved
function
even
in
the
absence
of
an
experimental
structure
In
focusing
on
the
active
site
there
is
opportunity
to
use
methods
similar
to
those
used
in
drug
design
to
predict
ligands
that
might
bind
to
the
proteins
These
would
be
putative
substrates
It
will
be
important
to
make
use
of
other
experimental
information
available
such
as
tissuedistribution
patterns
of
expression
and
catalogues
of
proteins
that
interact
Attempts
to
measure
function
312directly
for
instance
by
means
of
gene
knockouts
will
sometimes
provide
an
answer
but
are
unproductive
if
the
knockedout
phenotype
is
lethal
or
if
there
are
multiple
proteins
that
share
a
function
It
seems
likely
that
the
contribution
of
bioinformatics
to
prediction
of
protein
function
from
sequence
and
structure
will
not
be
a
simple
algorithm
that
provides
an
unambiguous
answer
In
contrast
there
is
reasonable
hope
that
there
will
someday
be
a
program
that
will
predict
structure
from
sequence
More
reasonable
aims
are
to
suggest
productive
experiments
and
to
contribute
to
the
interpretation
of
the
results
These
are
not
unworthy
goals
Drug
discovery
and
development
It
is
a
sobering
experience
to
ask
a
classroom
full
of
students
how
many
would
be
alive
today
without
at
least
one
course
of
drug
therapy
during
a
serious
illness
This
ignores
diseases
escaped
entirely
through
vaccination
Or
to
ask
the
students
how
many
of
their
surviving
grandparents
would
be
leading
lives
of
greatly
reduced
quality
without
regular
treatment
with
drugs
The
answers
are
eloquent
They
engender
fear
of
the
new
antibioticresistant
strains
of
infectious
microorganisms
It
is
necessary
to
develop
new
drugs
which
in
combination
with
genomic
information
that
can
improve
their
specificity
and
reduce
side
effects
will
extend
and
improve
our
lives
However
it
is
not
easy
to
be
a

For
a

a

it
must
be
1
safe
2
effective
3

both

you

of

its

Identification
of

that

to
any
measurable

compound
is
a

subsequently

them
are
quite
different

of

Development
of
the
lead
compound
extensive

of
variants
of
the

with
the
goal
of
building
in
all
the
desired
properties
and
enhancing
the
biological
activity
8
Preclinical
testing
in

and
with
animals
to
prove
effectiveness
and
safety
At
this
point
the
drug
may
be
patented
In
principle
one
wants
to
delay
patenting
as
long
as
possible
because
of
finite
lifetime
of
the
patent
Many
lengthy
steps
still
remain
before
the

can
be
sold

and
very
important
economic
and
legal
aspects
involving
patent
protection
and
estimation
of
returns
on
the
very
high
investment
that
is
required
To
develop
a
drug
first
you
must
choose
a
target
disease
You
will
want
to
study
what
is
known
about
its
possible
causes
its
symptoms
its
genetics
its
epidemiology
its
relationship
to
other
diseaseshuman
and
animaland
all
known
treatments
Assuming
that
the
potential
utility
of
a
drug
justifies
the
major
time
expense
and
effort
required
to
develop
one
you
are
now
ready
to
begin
You
must
develop
a
suitable
assay
with
which
to
detect
success
in
the
initial
phase
If
a
known
protein
is
the
target
binding
can
be
measured
directly
A
potential
antibacterial
drug
can
be
tested
by
its
effect
on
growth
of
the
pathogen
Some
compounds
might
be
tested
for
effects
on
eukaryotic
cells
grown
in
tissue
culture
If
a
laboratory
animal
is
susceptible
to
the
disease
compounds
can
be
tested
on
animal
subjects
However
compounds
may
have
different
effects
on
animals
and
humans
For
example
tamoxifen
now
a
drug
used
widely
against
breast
cancer
was
originally
developed
as
a
birthcontrol
pill
In
fact
it
is
a
fine
contraceptive
for
rats
but
promotes
ovulation
in
women
The
lead
compound
A
goal
in
the
early
stages
of
drug
development
is
identification
of
one
or
more
lead
compounds
A
lead
compound
is
any
substance
that
shows
the
biological
activity
you
seek
It
demonstrates
that
a
compound
exists
that
possesses
at
least
some
of
the
desired
properties
314
See

There
are
a
number
of
ways
to
find
lead
compounds

Serendipity

is
the
classic
example
2
Survey
of
natural
sources
Grind
and
find
is
the
medicinal
chemists
motto
Sometimes
traditional
remedies
point
to
a
source
of
active
compounds
For
example
digitalis
was
isolated
from
leaves
of
the
foxglove
which
had
been
used
for
congestive
heart
failure
Why
not
just
continue
to
use
the
traditional
remedy
Isolation
of
the
active
principle
makes
it
possible
to
regulate
dosage
and
to
explore
variants

Screening
The
US
National
Cancer
Institute
has
screened
tens
of
thousands
of
compounds
Screening
of
variants
is
also
very
important
after
a
lead
compound
has
been
found
8
Computer

Discovery
of
a
lead
compound
triggers
other
kinds
of

activities
Many
variants
of
the
lead
compound
must
be
tested
to
improve
its
effectiveness
and
to
build
in
other
essential
properties
For
instance
a
compound
that
binds
to
its
target
is
no
good
as
a
drug
unless
it
can
get
there
Deliverability
of
a
drug
to
a
target
within
the
body
requires
the
capacity
to
be
absorbed
and
transmitted
It
requires
metabolic
stability
It
requires
the
proper
solubility
profile
a
drug
must
be
sufficiently
watersoluble
to
be
absorbed
but
not
so
soluble
that
it
is
excreted
immediately
it
must
in
most
cases
be
sufficiently
lipidsoluble
to
get
across
membranes
but
not
so
lipidsoluble
that
it
is
merely
taken
up
by
fat
stores

quantitative

relationships
For
any
compound
with
pharmacological
activity
similar
compounds
typically
exhibit
related
activity
but
vary
in
potency
and
specificity
Starting
with
a
lead
compound
chemists
must
survey
large
numbers
of
related
molecules
to
optimize
desired
pharmacological
properties
To
search
systematically
it
would
be
very
useful
to
understand
how
the
variation
in
structural
and
physicochemical
features
in
the
family
of
molecules
is
correlated
with
pharmacological
properties
The
problem
is
that
there
are
very
many
possible
descriptors
for
characterizing
molecules
These
include
structural
features
such
as
the
nature
and
distribution
of
substituents
experimental
features
such
as
solubility
in
aqueous
and
organic
solvents
or
dipole
moments
and
computed
features
such
as
charges
on
individual
atoms
Quantitative

QSARs
provide
methods
for

the
pharmacological
activity
of
a
set
of
compounds
from
the
relationship
between
molecular
features
and
pharmacological
activity
based
on
test
cases
The

by
C
Hansch

has
been
of

A

and
those

the

Bioinformatics

These
include
target

and

of

and

Information

Target
selection
To
develop
a
drug
against
a
disease
it
is
necessary
to
select
a
protein
linked
to
the
disease
in
a
way
that
suggests
that
it
would
be
therapeutically
useful
to
affect
its
function
or
expression
New
high

particularly
of

of

for

Comparisons
between
antibioticresistant

of

Information
about

make
it
possible
to
target
not

a

protein
but
a

proteinprotein
interaction
Knowledge
of

supports

of

for

against

Of
particular
interest
are
metabolic
pathways
specific
to
microorganisms
and
the
proteins
that
participate
in
them
A
drug
affecting
such
a
target
is
less
likely
to
interact
with
a
human
homologue
with
consequent
side
effects
Proteins
with
sequences

clades
offer
the
possibility
of
broadspectrum
antibiotics
Conversely
gene
duplications
warn
of
potential
redundant
functions
with

to

of
the

Knowledge
of

the

of

against

Commitment
to
a
target
by
a
large
pharmaceutical
company
involves
a
very
heavy
investment
of
resources
The
profit
expected
to
flow
from
a
successful
drug
exerts
a
very
important
influence
on
the
choice
of
targets
actively
pursued
Analysis
of
the
history
of
drugs
that
currently
yield
high
profits
suggests
that
prediction
of
economic
returns
is
not
a
very
precise
science
Now
even
generously
supported
bioinformatics
efforts
are
much
less
expensive
than
laboratory
work
The
possibility
that
calculations
will
improve
predictions
and
enhance
profit
is
behind
the
espousal
of
bioinformatics
by
the
pharmaceutical
industry
in
addition
to
the
purely
scientific
contributions
of
bioinformatics
to
drug
discovery
This
contribution
to
economic
forecasting
is
especially
important
when
a
company
considers
highrisk
projects
such
as
those
aimed
at
developing
a
drug
against
a
new
class
of

Such

Prediction
of
a
lead
compound
Methods
for
predicting
ligands
suitable
as
lead
compounds
for
drug
discovery
can
be
divided
into
inductive
and
deductive
approaches
Inductive
methods
depend
on
correlations
between
known
affinities
of
some
test
set
of
compounds
and
molecular
features
characterizing
entire
libraries
of
potential
ligands
These
features
include
structural
properties
such
as
size
geometry
charge
distributions
and
specific
functional
groups
including
hydrogenbond
donors
and
acceptors
They
include
general
druglike
qualities
such
as
solubility
in
aqueous
and
organic
solvents
easy
route
of
administration
appropriate
distribution
in
body
tissues
and
metabolic
turnover
rate
The
relevant
characteristics
of
compounds
are
compiled
into
a
feature
vector
used
to
compare
the
overall
match
between
compounds
of
known
affinity
and
a
complete
library
The
requirements
for
organization
encoding
storage
and
searching
of
information
about
small
molecules
has
created
a
new
field
chemoinformatics
which
complements
bioinformatics
in
applications
to
drug
discovery
Deductive
methods
are
applicable
if
the
binding
site
on
the
target
protein
is
known
or
can
be
inferred
However
because
binding
affinity
and
specificity
are
only
two
requirements
for
a
lead
compoundadmittedly
essential
onesit
is
necessary
to
combine
deductive
methods
with
the
correlation
to
desirable
properties
as
in
the
purely
inductive
approach
Binding
assays
on
purified
systems
give
little
idea
of
the
behaviour
of
a
compound
as
a
drug
in
its
biological
context
Bioinformatics
has
a
contribution
to
make
in
integrating
the
information
available
from
molecular
and
cell
biology
and
physiology
and
pharmacology
to
help
bridge
the
gap
between
in

317experiments
and
in
vivo
therapeutic
activities
Molecular
modelling
in
drug
discovery
A
central
problem
in
drug
discovery
is
the
identification
of
a
compound
that
will
bind
tightly
and
specifically
to
a
target
protein
Tight
binding
is
necessary
for
efficacy
at
low
concentrations
Specificity
is
necessary
to
minimize
side
effects
If
the
structure
of
the
target
is
known
from
experiment
it
is
possible
to
apply
molecular
modelling
directly
to
ligand
design
If
the
structure
of
the
target
is
unknown
a
picture
of
the
binding
site
must
be
created
from
indirect
evidence
and
ligand
design
is
correspondingly
more
difficult
Ligand
design
without
the
target
structure
is
like
trying
to
catch
a
bank
robber
from
eyewitness
descriptions
ligand
design
to
a
target
of
known
structure
is
like
trying
to
catch
the
bank
robber
from
a
clear
image
on
a
CCTV
recording
Goals
of
molecular
modelling
applied
to
drug
design
include
ideally
suggestion
of
a
lead
compound
that
already
shows
reasonable
affinity
and
specificity
This
is
a
rare
achievement
analysis
of
compounds
known
to
bind
to
the
target
Understanding
the
important
interactions
serves
as
a
guide
to
design
and
testing
of
potential
ligands
and
for
selecting
structural
features
to
build
into
combinatorial
synthesis
of
libraries
In
the
case
of
antibacterial
or
antiviral
projects
a
model
of
the
proteinligand
complex
can
give
some
idea
of
how
easy
it
would
be
for
the
pathogen
to
develop
resistance
by
mutations
that
lower
the
affinity
pharmacophore
identification
is
the
identification
of
common
substructures
of
many
compounds
that
share
a
pharmacological
activity
or
at
least
that
bind
to
the
same
site
on
a
protein
The
hypothesis
is
that
there
is
some
common
constellation
of
atoms
within
the
structures
that
is
responsible
The
computational
problem
of
extracting
the
pharmacophore
from
a
set
of
compounds
is
similar
to
that
of
structural
alignment
of
a
set
of
homologous
proteins
Although
typical
ligands
are
much
smaller
than
proteins
the
combinatorial
problems
are
more
severe
because
one
has
lost
the
linear
ordering
of
the
residues
in
proteins

Docking
prediction
of
ligand
geometry
and
affinity
Docking
is
prediction
of
ligand
binding
It
includes
prediction
both
of
binding
of
small
molecules
to
proteins
and
of
proteinprotein
binding
The
goals
of
docking
are
1
to
identify
the
binding
site
on
the
protein
and
determine
the
position
and
orientation
of
the
ligand
and
2
to
estimate
the
affinity
1
Identification
of
mode
of
binding
Docking
of
small
molecules
to
proteins
requires
matching
of
the
ligand
to
a
site
on
a
protein
of
known
structure
The
binding
site
may
be
known
in
advance
or
it
may
be
necessary
to
try
many
different
modes
of
apposition
of
the
ligand
and
protein
to
predict
the
optimal
binding
site
The
basis
for
docking
is
the
identification
of
complementarity
in
size
shape
and
distribution
of
charge
polarity
and
potential
for
hydrophobic
and
hydrogenbonding
interactions
A
complication
is
the
possibility
of
flexibility
in
both
partners
Small
organic
molecules
containing
many
single
bonds
have
high
degree
of
conformational
flexibility
Drug
designers
love
structures
with
rings
and
bridges
Many
proteins
show
conformational
changes
upon
binding
ligands
Therefore
the
experimental
structure
of
an
unligated
protein
cannot
be
assumed
to
serve
as
a
rigid
target
for
docking

Estimation
of

It

difficult
to
estimate
absolute
affinities
However
comparative
docking
can
provide
useful
information
about
relative
affinities
A
suitable
scoring
function
that
can
predict
the
ranking
of
different
ligands
in
approximate
order
of
affinity
allows
selectivity
and
setting
of
priorities
in
experimental
testing
Such
scoring
schemes
can
be
ab

based
on
the
kinds
of
force

in
the

comparative
docking

Development

Morphine

The

heroin
traverses
the
bloodbrain
barrier
more
readily
giving
it
a
more
rapid
onset
of
action
Both
codeine
and
heroin
are
metabolized
to
produce
morphine
the
active
form
Codeine
is
therefore
a
natural
example
of
a
prodrug
an
inactive
agent
that
is
converted
to
an
active
one
The
conversion
depends
on
a
cytochrome
CYP2D6
which
is
absent
in
510
of
white
people
and
13
of
AfricanAmericans
and
Asians
Morphine
and
codeine
have
been
applied
in
medicine
and
surgery
as
analgesics
or
drugs
to
relieve
severe
pain
Side
effects
include
passivity
and
euphoria
and
physical
dependence
and
addiction
Drug
developers
have
therefore
long
sought
a
compound
that
would
relieve
pain
without
the
harmful
side
effects
Of
course
there
was
no
guarantee
that
this
would
be
possible
Synthetic
variants
of
morphine
allow
correlation
of
biological
effects
with
chemical
structure
One
approach
is
to
try
to
simplify
the
structure
The
goals
are
1
to
infer
the
minimal
pharmacophore
required
for
activity
and
2
if
possible
to
dissect
the
parts
of
the
structure
that
relieve
pain
away
from
those
causing
addiction
Morphine
codeine
and
heroin
are
rigid
compounds
containing
five
fused
rings
Levorphanol
differs
from
morphine
by
loss
of
the
bridging
oxygen
ie
removal
of
the
tetrahydrofuran
ring
and
one
of
the
hydroxyl
groups
Fig

It
is
a
more
potent
analgesic
than
morphine
but
still
addictive
Benzomorphan
cyclazocine
and
pentazocine

The
addictive
effects
of
these
compounds
are
less
than
those
of
morphine
and
levorphanol
Demerol
which
opens
the
cyclohexene
ring
and
methadone
which
has
no
fused
rings
retain
analgesic
activity
sharing
even
smaller
common
substructures
with
morphine
From
these
structures
one
can
infer
the
pharmacophore
shown

Etorphine

the

This
exploration
of
variants
went
on
before
the
natural
receptors
were
identified
We
now
know
that
the
natural
targets
of
action
of
morphine
and
related
molecules
are
receptors
for
endogenous
peptides
called
endorphins
These
include
Endorphin

Dynorphin
YGGFLRRIRPKLKWDNQ
And

Morphine
is
therefore
a
natural
peptidomimetic
a
nonpeptide
that
shares
a
structure
and
activity
with
a
peptide
Several
classes
of
receptors
are
known
including
and
types
and
a
recently
discovered
fourth
type
called
ORL1
where
ORL
means
opiatereceptor
like
They
are
Gproteincoupled
receptors
similar
in
structure
to
bacteriorhodopsin
see
Fig

Their
sequences
are
about
5070
identical
at
the
residue
level
Different
ligandsnatural
and
synthetichave
differential
affinity
to
different
receptors
and
different
kinetics
of
binding
and
dissociation
The
natural
targets
of
morphine
are
receptors
It
is
thought
that
receptors
tend
to
be
more
involved
in
physical
dependence
and
addiction
than
receptors
although
this
statement
of
the
situation
is
extremely
oversimplified
Nevertheless
the
suggestion
is
that
an
approach
to
producing
a
drug
that
provides
analgesia
with
reduced
side
effects
is
to
look
at
the
distribution
of
affinities
of
compounds

They

this

specifically
prostaglandin
cyclooxygenases
A
wellknown
side
effect

aspirin
is
bleeding
from
the
walls
of
the
stomach
This
occurs
because
prostaglandins
the
production
of
which
aspirin
inhibits
suppress
acid
secretions
by
the
stomach
and
promote
formation
of
a
mucus
coating
protecting
the
stomach
lining
Aspirin
and
other
NSAIDs
inhibit
two
closely
related
prostaglandin
cyclooxygenases
called
COX1
and
COX2
Unfortunately
the
same
abbreviations
are
used
for
cytochrome
oxidases

and

COX1
is
expressed
constitutively
in
the
stomach

COX2
is

This
suggests
that
a

Aspirin
Aspirin
is
one
of
the
oldest
of
folk
remedies
and
newest
of
scientific
ones
Hippocrates
noted
the
effectiveness
of
preparations
of
willow
leaves
or
bark
to
assuage
pain
and
reduce
fever
The
active
ingredient
salicin
was
purified
in
1828
and
synthesized
in
1859
by
Kolbe
The
mechanism
of
its
action
was
unknown
and
indeed
remained
unknown
until
in
the
1970s
J
Vane
and
colleagues
discovered
that
aspirin
acts
by
blocking
prostaglandin
synthesis
Not
knowing
the
mechanism
of
action
was
never
an
impediment
to
its
use
A
century
ago
sodium
salicylate
was
used
in
the
treatment
of
arthritis
Because
stomach
irritation
was
a
serious
side
effect
F
Hoffman
sought
to
reduce
the
compounds
acidity
by
forming
acetylsalicylic
acid
or
aspirin
Aspirin
was
the
first
synthetic
drug
which
launched
the
modern
pharmaceutical
industry
The
name
salicin
comes
from
the
Latin
name
for
willow
Salix
and
the
name
aspirin
comes
from
a
for
acetyl
and
spir
from
the
Spirea
plant
another
natural
source
of
salicin
Aspirin
has
the
effect
of
reducing
fever
and
giving
relief
from
aches
and
pains
In
high
doses
it
is
effective
against
arthritis
Aspirin
is
also
used
for
prevention
and
treatment
of
heart
attacks
and
strokes
The
applications
to
cardiovascular
disease
depend
on
inhibition
of
blood
clotting
by
suppressing
prostaglandin
control
over
platelet
clumping
The
many
applications
of
aspirin
reflect
the

Hydrophobic
cluster
analysis
Suppose
a
region
of
a
protein
forms
an
helix
To
represent
its
surface
imagine
winding
the
sequence
into
an
helix
even
if
in
fact
it
forms
a
strand
of
sheet
or
loop
in
the
native
structure
Then
ink
the
surface
of
the
helix
and
roll
it
onto
a
sheet
of
paper
to
print
the
names
of
the
residues
By
rolling
the
helix
over
twice
all
surfaces
are
visible
From
such
a
diagram
hydrophobic
patches
on
surfaces
of
helices
can
be
identified
In
this
way
it
is
possible
to
try
to
predict
which
regions
of
the
sequence
actually
form
helices
in
the
native
structure
Comparisons
of
hydrophobic
clusters
can
also
be

Introduction
Like
all
good
first
acts
this
short
interlude
is
anticipatory
It
provides
the
background
for
the
final
two
chapters
This
is
a
tribute
to
the
recent
growth
in
systems
biology
in
the
previous
edition
the
subject
could
be
contained
in
a
single
chapter
The
increased
interest
in
systems
biology
is
both
the
effect
and
if
not
the
cause
certainly
a
contributor
to
the
motivation
for
development
of
novel
highthroughput
data
streams
Like
most
of
contemporary
biology
systems
biology
is
datadriven
But
where
are
the
data
driving
us
They
are
driving
us
to
the
exploration
of
new
directions
and
attitudes
Specifically
there
is
focus
on
integration
of
the
components
of
biological
activity
at
the
cellular
organismic
and
ecological
levels
It
is
justifiable
to
repeat
that
for
generations
biochemists
have
been
taking
things
apart
Systems
biology
has
the
goal
of
putting
them
back
together
This
change
in
focus
demands
new
ideas
and
new
mathematical
techniques
with
which
to
express
them
Many
patterns
of
interaction
have
the
form
of
networks
Many
networks
are
already
familiar
the
web
is
a
pervasive
example
A
road
map
of
the
city
in
which
you
live
portrays
a
network
of
locations
connected
by
streets
In
biology
metabolic
pathways
and
phylogenetic
trees
are
networks
As
phylogenetic
trees
show
the
mathematical
representation
of
a
network
is
a
graph
A
strictly
hierarchical
graph
or
a
tree
structure
is
a
simple
type
of
graph
The
BandeltDress
representation
of
phylogenetic
relationships

Example
57
is
a
more
complex
form
of
graph
We
are
interested
in
both
the
static
and
dynamic
aspects
of
networks
A
graph
showing
the
underground
rail
system
in
a
city
such
as
London
indicates
the
stations
and
the
links
between
them
The
familiar
map
reports
the
static
structure
of
the
network
But
although
stations
and
tracks
do
not
move
trains
and
their
passengers
do
The
traffic
patterns
in
a
network
at
a
particular
time
are
an
aspect
of
its
dynamic
structure
So
too
are
the
variations
in
traffic
patterns
Although
the
static
structure
of
the
London
undergroundthe
stations
and
tracksis
the
same
at
noon
and
midnight
the
dynamic
structurethe
traffic
patternis
very
different
Similarly
in
an
E
coli
cell
the
potential
metabolic
pathways
are
fixed
These
depend
on
the
330catalytic
activities
of
the
enzymes
that
the
genome
encodes
plus
spontaneous
reactions
not
requiring
enzymes
But
depending
on
the
physiological
state
of
the
cell
the
traffic
through
the
network
of
metabolic
pathways
may
be
very
different
Indeed
the
metabolic
network
is
itself
governed
by
a
supervising
control
network
that
responds
to
internal
and
external
changes
A
famous
example
is
control
of
the
Lac
operon
in
response
to
the
composition
of
the
medium
We
have
suggested
that
an
initial
goal
of
systems
biology
is
to
identify
the
active
networks
in
cells
organisms
and
ecosystems
and
to
understand
the
properties
of
their
components
and
the
interactions
among
them
Perhaps
an
ultimate
challenge
would
be
this
suppose
we
know
the
complete
structure
of
the
cellular
networks
and
know
exact
details
specifying
quantitatively
the
inputs
and
outputs
of
each
network
element
That
is
suppose
for
simplicity
that
we
consider
a
cell
in
some
fixed
physiological
state
Assume
that
we
know
the
complete
inventory
of
cellular
enzymes
and
we
know
exactly
which
reactions
they
catalyse
and
the
relevant
kinetic
parameters
Would
the
behaviour
of
the
cell
be
predictable
Given
a
set
of
conditionsinitial
metabolite
concentrations
would
we
be
able
to
model
computationally
the
metabolic
traffic
patterns
Some
systems
biologists
have
already
achieved
some
interesting
results
in
modelling
the
dynamics
of
some
fragments
of
metabolic
networks
under
simplifying
assumptions
How
can
we
try
to
set
reasonable
goals
We
learn
from
physics
that
some
dynamical
systems
are
stable
and
robust
to
perturbations
For
instance
a
golf
ball
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
a
hill
will
after
a
small
displacement
up
the
hill
return
and
come
to
rest
at
its
initial
position
Other
systems
are
not
stable
A
golf
ball
balanced
precariously
on
the
peak
of
a
hill
will
after
a
small
displacement
roll
down
the
hill
Living
things
are
more
complicated
because
the
environment
is
changeable
There
is
consensus
that
instead
of
asking
whether
a
cell
is
or
is
not
stable
we
must
ask
whether
or
not
it
is
robust
Before
trying
to
answer
such
a
question
we
shall
have
to
devote
some
attention
to
a
careful
characterization
of
robustness
a
matter
of
considerable
delicacy
We
also
learn
from
physics
that
for
a
system
consisting
of
a
small
number
of
particles
we
can
in
classical
mechanics
predict
their
trajectories
precisely
in
many
cases
knowing
the
forces
between
them
and
given
the
initial
conditions
But
for
large
numbers
of
particles
for
example
the
air
in
a
bicycle
tyre
even
in
classical
mechanics
we
can
hope
for
no
more
than
to
derive
some
statistical
regularities
There
is
an
analogue
of
that
in
biology
in
modelling
epidemics
of
a
disease
Suppose
we
know
the
state
of
a
population
the
typical
severity
and
time
course
of
the
disease
in
individuals
and
the
probability
of
transmission
It
is
then
possible
to
predict
the
spread
of
the
disease
in
the
population
We
cannot
predict
whether
any
particular
individual
will
become
ill
but
we
can
do
a
reasonable
job
of
modelling
the
number
of
affected
individuals
as
a
function
of
time
In
particular
we
can
try
to
decide
whether
the
parameters
suggest
that
there
will
be
an
epidemicuncontrolled
spread
of
disease
throughout
the
populationor
only
selfcontained
pockets
Such
ideas
set
out
the
program
for
our
discussion
of
systems
biology
as
follows
What
are
the
data
How
can
we
represent
and
analyse
them
What
concepts
do
we
need
to
understand
if
we
are
to
be
able
to
make
sense
of
the
data
What
kinds
of
predictions
can
we
make

Networks
and
graphs
In
the
abstract
networks
have
the
form
of
graphs
See
Box

The
routes
between
cities
on
the
map
of
Sweden
in
Figure
54
is
a
network
represented
by
a
graph
similar
to
those
appearing
in
systems
biology
Each
city
is
a
node
The
thick
lines
joining
them
indicate
routes
Other
examples
familiar
to
many
readers
are
the
map
of
the
London
Underground
1
and
maps
of
the
subway
systems
of
other
cities
see
Box
72
Each
station
is
a
node
of
the
graph
and
edges
correspond
to
tracks
connecting
the
stations
The
modern
London
Underground
map
shows
the
topology
of
the
network
it
does
not
quantitatively
represent
the
geography
of
the
area
An
early
map
from
1925
did
maintain
geographic
accuracy
2
This
was
possible
when
the
system
was
simpler
than
it
is
now
Some
of
the
maps
now
posted
in
the
Paris
Mtro
are
fairly
accurate
geographically
Considered
as
networks
a
geographically
accurate
map
and
a
simplified
map
with
the
same
topology
correspond
to
the
same
graph
The
London
Underground
network
is
fully
connected
in
that
there
is
on
most
days
a
route
between
any
two
stations
Many
questions
familiar
to
commuters
are
shared
in
the
analysis
of
biological
networks
for
example
what
are
the
routes
connecting

The
idea
of
a
graph
Mathematically
a
graph
consists
of
a
set
of
vertices
V
and
a
set
of
edges
E
Each
edge
is
specified
by
a
pair
of
vertices
In
a
directed
graph
the
edges
are
ordered
pairs
of
vertices
In
a
labelled
graph
there
is
a
value
associated
with
each
edge
A
directed
graph
is
a
special
case
of
a
labelled
graph
consider
the
arrowheads
as
labels
An
undirected
unlabelled
graph
specifies
the
connectivity
of
a
network
but
not
the
distances
between
vertices
the
topology
but
not
the
geometry
as
in
the
modern
London
Underground
map
Labels
on
the
edges
can
indicate
distances
For
example
some
phylogenetic
trees
indicate
only
the
topology
of
the
ancestry
Others
indicate
quantitatively
the
amount
of
divergence
between
species
Phylogenetic
trees
are
often
drawn
with
the
lengths
of
the
branches
indicating
the
time
since
the
last
common
ancestor
This
is
a
pictorial
device
for
labelling
the
edges
Some
graphs
do
not
correspond
to
physical
structures
and
in
any
event
edge
labels
need
not
indicate
only
internode
distances
they
can
be
far
more
general
For
example
the
links
in
a
network
of
metabolic
pathways
might
be
labelled
to
reflect
flow
capacities

Regarding
different
lines
as
subnetworks
how
easy
is
it
to
transfer
from
one
to
another
that
is
what
is
the
nature
of
the
patterns
of
connectivity
In
case
of
failure
of
one
or
more
links
does
the
network
remain
fully
connected
If
so
this
would
be
an
example
of
robustness
Connectivity
in
networks
If
V
A
and
V
Z
are
vertices
in
a
graph
a
path
from
V
A
to

of
vertices
V

such
that
an

in
the

successive
pair
of

V

The
number
of
vertices
in
the
chain
including
the
initial
and
final
vertices
is
called
the
length
of
the
path
A
cycle
is
a
path
of
length
2
in
a
nondirected
graph
for
which
the
initial
and
final
endpoints
are
the
same
but
in
which
no
intermediate
link
is
repeated
A
graph
that
contains
a
path
between
any
two
vertices
is
called
connected
Alternatively
a
graph
may
split
into
several
connected
components
The
graph
in
the
Box
71
contains
two
connected
components
one
containing
five
vertices
and
one
containing
only
one
vertex
In
the
extreme
a
graph
could
contain
many
vertices
but
no
edges
at
all
It
is
often
useful
to
determine
the
shortest
path
between
any
two
nodes
and
to
characterize
a
network
by
the
distribution
of
shortest
path
lengths
The
phrase
six
degrees
of
separationalso
the
title
of
a
play
by
John
Guare
made
into
a
filmrefers
to
the
assertion
attributed
originally
to
Marconi
that
if
the
people
in
the
world
are
vertices
of
a
graph
and
the
graph
contains
an
edge
whenever
two
people
know
each
other
then
the
graph
is
connected
and
there
is
a
path
between
any
two
vertices
with
length

A
tree
is
a
special
form
of
graph
A
tree
is
a
connected
graph
containing
only
one
path
between
each
pair
of
vertices
A
hierarchy
is
a
tree
examples
include
chains
of
command
and
Linnaean
taxonomy
Note
that
some
family
trees
are
not
trees
in
the
mathematical
sense
examples
are
plentiful
in
the
royal
families
of
Europe
A
tree
cannot
contain
a
cycle
if
it
did
there
would
be
two
paths
from
the
initial
point
the
final
point
to

The
density
of
connections
or
the
mean
number
of
edges
per
vertex
characterizes
the
structure
of
a
graph

connected

N
vertices
has
N
1
connections

a
graph
with
no
edges

0
Nervous
systems
of
higher
animals
achieve
their
power
not
only
by
containing
large
number
of
neurons
but
also
by
having
high
connectivities
333In
some
systems
there
are
limits
on
numbers
of
connections
for
many
human
societies
in
the
graph
in
which
individuals
are
the
vertices
and
edges
link
people
married
to
each
other
each
node
has
connectivity
0
or
1
For
any
hydrocarbon
the
graph
in
which
carbon
and
hydrogen
atoms
are
the
vertices
and
edges
link
atoms
bonded
to
each
other
each
node
has
four
or
fewer
connections
In
other
networks
connectivities
follow
observable
regularities
see
Box
73
For
instance
the
worldwide
web
can
be
considered
as
a
directed
graph
Individual
documents
are
the
nodes
and
hyperlinks
are
the
edges
It
is
observed
that
the
distribution
of
incoming
and
outgoing
links
follow
power
laws
P
k
probability
of
k
edges
is
proportional
to
k
q
where
q
21
for
incoming
links
and
q
245
for
outgoing
links
The
density
of
connections
is
very
important
in
defining
the
properties
of
a
network
For
instance
the
interactions
that
spread
disease
among
humans
andor
animals
form
a
network
Whether
a
disease
will
cause
an
epidemic
depends
not
only
on
the
ease
Box

Smallworld
networks
Many
observed
networks
including
biological
networks
the
worldwide
web
and
electric
power
distribution
grids
have
the
characteristics
of
high
clustering
and
short
path
lengths
They
include
relatively
few
nodes
with
very
large
numbers
of
connections
called
hubs
and
many
that
contain
few
connections
These
combine
to
produce
short
path
lengths
between
all
nodes
From
this
feature
they
are
called
smallworld
networks
Such
networks
tend
to
be
fairly
robust
staying
connected
after
failure
of
random
nodes
Failure
of
a
hub
would
be
disastrous
but
is
unlikely
because
there
are
so
few
hubs
The
1987
fire
in
the
Kings
Cross
underground
station
in
London
had
a
devastating
effect
on
the
underground
network
because
Kings
Cross
is
a
hub
Many
networks
notably
the
worldwide
web
are
continuously
adding
nodes
The
connectivity
distribution
tends
to
remain
fairly
constant
as
the
network
grows
These
are
called
scalefree

of
transmission

any
particular
interaction
but
on
the
density
of

As
the
density
of
connectionsthe
rate
of
interactionsincreases
the
system
can
exhibit
a
qualitative
change
in
behaviour
analogous
to
a
phase
change
in
physical
chemistry
from
a
situation
in
which
the
disease
remains
under
control
to
an
epidemic
spreading
through
an
entire
population

Two
historical
epidemics
associated
with
wars
demonstrate
the
distinction
between
topology
and
geometry
in
network
connectivity
In
the
early
years
of
the
Peloponnesian
War
Athens
suffered
a
severe
epidemic
From
Thucydides
detailed
description
of
the
symptoms
the
disease
was
probably
bubonic
plague
A
factor
contributing
to
its
transmission
was
the
crowding
of
people
into
the
city
from
the
more
militarily
vulnerable
surrounding
countryside
After
World
War
I
an
epidemic
of
influenza
killed
an
estimated
20
million
people
more
than
died
in
the
war
itself
Longdistance
travel
by
soldiers
returning
from
the
war
helped
spread
the
disease
Any
epidemic
needs
an
infectious
agent
and
a
high
density
of
routes
of
transmission
These
examples
show
that
the
controlling
factor
is
the
density
of
the
connections
and
not
necessarily
the
density
of
the
people
A
change
in
behaviour
analogous
to
the
transition
to
an
epidemic
appears
in
nuclear
fission

Above

If

of

and

the

of

the

can
be
seen
as
the

of
increasing

The
background
to
Michael

Copenhagen
involves
the
attempts
before
and
during
the
Second

to
estimate
the

of
the
critical

in

to
determine
whether

Dynamics
stability
and
robustness
An
unlabelled
undirected
graph
gives
a
static
structure
of
the
topology
of
a
network
For
our
molecular
interaction
networks
this
may
be
an
adequate
description
of
many
of
the
physical
interactions
For
some
networks
such
as
metabolic
pathways
or
patterns
of
traffic
in
cities
the
dynamics
of
the
system
depend
on
the
transmission
capacities
of
the
individual
links
These
capacities
can
be
indicated
as
labels
of
the
edges
of
the
graph
This
allows
modelling
of
patterns
of
flow
through
the
network
Examples
include
route
planning
in
travel
or
deliveries
Note
that
the
shortest
path
may
well
not
give
optimal
throughput
In
many
cities
taxi
drivers
are
exquisitely
sensitiveand

In
molecular
biology
metabolic

and
signal

are
networks
that
lend
themselves
to
pathway
and
flow
analysis
Optimal

involves
determining
the
optimal

through
an
edit
graph
Although
much
is
known
about
the
mechanisms
of
individual
elements
of
control
in
signalling
pathways
understanding
their
integration
is
a
subject
of
current
research
For
instance
the
idea
that
healthy
cells
and
organisms
are
in
stable
states
is
certainly
no
more
than
an
approximation
and
in
most
cases
a
gross
idealization
The
description
of
the
actual
dynamic
state
of
the
metabolic
and
regulatory
networks
is
a
very
delicate
problem
Understanding
how
cells
achieve
even
an
apparent
approximation
to
stability
is
also
quite
tricky
It
is
likely
that
great
redundancy
of
control
processes
lies
at
its
basis
Regulation
is
based
on
the
resultant
of
many
individual
control
mechanisms
here
a
short
feedback
loop
there
a
multistep
cascade
Somehow
the
independent
actions
of
all
the
individual
signals
combine
to
achieve
an
overall
integrated
result
It
is
like
the
operation
of
the
invisible
hand
that
according
to
Adam
Smith
coordinates
individual
behaviour
into
the
regulation
of
national
economies
Stability
and
robustness
Stability
is
the
property
of
being
able
to
continue
to
carry
out
approximately
the
same
set
of
activities
when
challenged
by
small
fluctuations
in
conditions
Take
it
in
your
stride
A
stable
system
is
not
necessarily
a
static
system
Robustness
is
the
property
of
being
able
to
continue
to
carry
out
the
same
or
if
necessary
a
more
substantially
modified
set
of
activities
that
achieve
similar
goals
after
challenge
by
larger
perturbations
Sometimes
but
not
always
this
involves
the
attainment
of
a
different
stable
state
An
example
would
be
a
switch
from
anaerobic
to
aerobic
metabolism
in
yeast
which
involves
major
physiological
changes

of

are

States
of
a
network
of
processes
At
equilibrium
one
or
more
forward
and
reverse
processes
occur
at
compensating
rates
to
leave
the
amounts
of
different
substances
unchanging
Chemical
equilibria
are
generally
selfadjusting
upon
changes
in
conditions
or
in
concentrations
of
reactants
or
products
A
steady
state
will
exist
if
the
total
rate
of
processes
that
produce
a
substance
is
the
same
as
the
total
rate
of
processes
that
consume
it
For
instance
the
twostep
conversion
could
maintain
the
amount
of
B
constant
provided
that
the
rate
of
production
of
B
the
process
A
B
is
the
same
as
the
rate
of
its
consumption
the
process
B
C
The
net
effect
would
be
to
convert
A
to
C
A
cyclic
process
could
maintain
a
steady
state
in
all
its
components
A
steady
state
in
such
a
cyclic
process
with
all
reactions
proceeding
in
one
direction
is
very
different
from
an
equilibrium
state
Nevertheless
in
some
cases
it
is
still
true
that
altering
external
conditions
produces
a
shift
to
another
neighbouring
steady
state
States
that
vary
periodically
appear
in
the
regulation
of
the
cell
cycle
circadian
rhythms
and
seasonal
changes
such
as
annual
patterns
of
breeding
in
animals
and
flowering
in
plants
Circadian
and
seasonal
cycles
have
their
origins
in
the
regular
progressions
of
the
day
and
year
but
have
evolved
a
certain
degree
of
internalization
Many
equilibrium
and
some
steadystate
conditions
are
stable
in
the
sense
that
concentrations
of
most
metabolites
are
changing
slowly
if
at
all
and
the
system
is
robust
to
small
changes
in
external
conditions
The
alternative
is
a
chaotic
state
in
which
small
changes
in
conditions
can
cause
very
large
responses
Weather
is
a
chaotic
system
the
meteorologist
Lorenz
asked
Does
the
flap
of
a
butterflys
wings
in
Brazil
set
off
a
tornado
in
Texas
In
a
carefully
regulated
system
chaos
is
usually
well
worth
avoiding
and
it
is
likely
that
life
has
evolved
to
damp
down
the
responses
to
the
kinds
of
fluctuations
that
might
give
rise
to
it
Chaotic
dynamics
does
sometimes
produce
the
approximations
to
stable
states
these
are
called
strange
attractors

Some
sources
of
ideas
for
systems
biology
Several
related
ideas
are
important
in
coping
with
the
static
and
dynamic
aspects
of
the
networks
studied
in
systems
biology
These
include
complexity
entropy
randomness
redundancy
robustness
predictability
and
chaos
We
deal
with
these
in
our
daily
lives
but
without
the
need
to
define
them
precisely
and
quantitatively
How
well
do
we
really
understand
these
concepts
What
are
the
relationships
among
them
And
how
can
they
be
used
to
illuminate
biology
in
general
and
systems
biology
in
particular
Complexity
of
sequences
The
simplest
complex
object
in
biology
is
a
sequence
We
have
all
heard
of
random
sequences
and
probably
agree
that
the
more
random
the
sequence
the
more
complex
it
is
For
example
genomic
sequences
contain
lowcomplexity
regions
In
the
human
genome
such
regions
include
simple
repeats
or
microsatellites
or
regions
of
highly
skewed
nucleotide
composition
such
as
ATrich
or
GCrich
regions
or
polypurine
and
polypyrimidine
stretches
Are
these
regions
more
or
less
random
than
a
region
containing
a
gene
that
encodes
a
specific
protein
How
can
such
properties
of
sequences
be
measured
Take
a
sequence
of
characters
What
determines
the
amount
of
information
needed
to
specify
the
next
character
in
each
sequence
Less
information
is
required
if
the
set
of
possible
charactersA
T
G
Cis
very
small
or
if
the
distribution
is
very
skewedAATAAAAATAAAthan
if
the
set
is
very
large
and
the
ratios
of
different
characters
is
more
even
How
can
we
make
this
quantitative
Genomic
sequences
are
limited
to
the
characters
A
T
G
and
C
To
identify
each
symbol
it
is
enough
to
ask
two
yesorno
questions
For
instance
Question
1
is
it
a
purine
or
a
pyrimidine
Purine
implies
it
is
A
or
G
Question
2
Is
it
6amino
or
6keto
6Amino
implies
it
is
A
or
C
Knowing
the
answer
to
these
two
questions
is
enough
for
us
to
identify
one
of
the
four
bases
uniquely
Representing
yes
with
1
and
no
with
0
each
yesorno
question
provides
1
binary
digit
or
1
bit
of
information
We
could
encode
each
nucleotide
of
a
genome
sequence
as
a
twobit
binary
string
To
identify
a
character
of
the
ordinary
alphabet
abcd
z
requires
more
than
two
yesno
questions
It
is
therefore
reasonable
to
think
that
a
character
string
of
full
text
is
more
complex
than
a
genomic
sequence
of
the
same
length
containing
only
the
characters
A
T
G
and
C
Questions
of
how
much
information
is
needed
to
specify
an
amino
acid
appear
in
the
genetic
code
itself
How
many
nucleotides
are
required
to
encode
20
amino
acids
If
each
position
in
a
gene
can
contain
one
of
four
nucleotides
then
there
are
only
16
possible
dinucleotides
not
enough
So
if
the
same
number
of
nucleotides
is
to
be
required
for
each
amino
acid
there
must
be
at
least
three
337nucleotides
per
codon
as
observed
Because
there
are
only
20
amino
acids
the
triplet
code
contains
redundancy
Why
not
make
do
with
fewer
amino
acids
If
15
amino
acids
plus
a
STOP
signalnot
unreasonablewould
suffice
then
from
the
information
point
of
view
a
doublet
code
would
be
possible
However
a
twobase
codontwobase
anticodon
interaction
would
probably
not
have
adequate
stability
It
has
been
possible
to
embed
these
ideas
in
a
more
formal
framework
Shannons
definition
of
entropy
In
1948
CE
Shannon
introduced
the
concept
of
entropy
into
information
theory
as
part
of
his
analysis
of
signal
transmission
Suppose
a
text
contains
symbols
with
relative
probability
p
i
Shannons
measure
of
entropy
is
The
entropy
H
can
be
interpreted
as
the
minimum
average
number
of
bits
per
symbol
required
to
transmit
the
sequence
For
example
for
a
genomic
sequence
with
equimolar
base
composition
p
G
p
C
p

p

Note
that

The
result
H
2
for
the
gene
sequence
with
equimolar
base
composition
recovers
our
informal
result
that
2
bits
or
two
yesorno
questions
are
required
For
a
sequence
limited
to
two
equiprobable
characters
A
and
T
p

This
also
makes
sense
because
knowing
that
the
only
choices
are
A
and
T
we
can
decide
which
it
is
with
one
yesorno
question
or
1
bit
Suppose
that
a
sequence
is
known
to
have
the
skewed
nucleotide
composition
p
A
p
T
042
and
p
G
p
C
008
Then
What
is
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
the
value
H
163
is
less
than
2
It
suggests
that
we
might
be
able
to
encode
the
sequence
with
fewer
than
2
bitscharacter
on
average
The
Morse
code
for
telegraphy
took
such
advantage
of
unequal
letter
distribution
frequencies
to
encode
common
letters
with
short
sequences
and
uncommon
letters
with
longer
ones
For
instance
E
dot
length
one
and
J
dotdashdashdash
length
four
Note
that
to
take
advantage
of
entropy
values
lower
than
those
corresponding
to
equal
distributions
of
characters
requires
variablelength
encoding
Huffman
devised
an
algorithm
for
assigning
lengthoptimal
codes
to
symbols
knowing
their
relative
probabilities
It
would
be
difficult
to
devise
a
Morse
code
for
single
nucleotides
because
the
fact
that
we
can
easily
encode
them
with
no
more
than
2
bits
doesnt
give
us
much
room
to
play
with
after
all
we
cant
subdivide
a
single
bit
However
consider
encoding
a
genome
sequence
at
the
trinucleotide
338level
Assume
that
there
is
no
bias
in
trinucleotide
frequencies
other
than
that
expected
from
the
mononucleotide
frequencies
That
is
p
ATC
p
A
p
T
p
C
etc
There
are
64
trinucleotides
to
encode
Six
bits
per
triplet
obviously
suffice
but
for
the
skewed
distribution
p
A
p
T
042
and
p
G
p
C
008
H
49
We
could
encode
the
sequence
using
5
bits
per
trinucleotide
instead
of
6
The
entropy
is
lower
than
for
an
equimolar
sequence
because
the
uncertainty
in
each
transmitted
symbol
is
not
complete
it
is
more
likely
to
be
A
or
T
than
G
or
C
In
principle
we
can
use
this
knowledge
to
improve
the
coding
efficiency
Conversely
looking
at
distributions
of
oligonucleotides
dinucleotides
triplets
etc
is
a
useful
way
to
detect
biologically
significant
patterns
Codon
usage
patterns
in
proteincoding
regions
are
examples
Some
algorithms
for
gene
identification
make
use
of
biases
in
coding
regions
of
frequencies
of
hexanucleotides
Although
the
actual
genetic
code
does
not
achieve
the
theoretical
efficiency
that
entropy
calculations
suggest
and
indeed
there
does
not
even
seem
to
be
selection
for
reduction
in
the
size
of
nonviral
genomes
it
is
clear
that
the
redundancy
in
the
genetic
code
has
biological
significance
Many
singlebase
mutations
are
silent
Conservative
mutations
allow
proteins
to
evolve
with
small
nonlethal
changes
that
cumulatively
can
achieve
large
changes
in
structure
and
function
And
of
course
the
redundancy
in
having
two
copies
of
the
genetic
information
in
two
strands
of
DNA
is
used
to
detect
and
correct
errors
in
replication
and
translation
and
to
repair
DNA
damage
Randomness
of
sequences
The
Shannon
entropy
of
sequences
is
related
to
the
idea
of
randomness
another
concept
that
we
know
from
everyday
life
without
worrying
too
much
about
exactly
what
it
means

Periodic
sequences
such
as

are
also
of
low
complexity
In
contrast
a
truly
random
sequence
has
no
description
shorter
than
the
sequence
itself
The
relationship
between
complexity
randomness
and
compressibility
One
way
to
shorten
the
specification
of
a
nonrandom
sequence
is
to
compress
it
We
all
use
compression
algorithms
on
our
computer
files
to
save
disk
space
If
a
sequence
is
truly
random
in
the
sense
of
Kolmogorov
it
cannot
be
compressed
By
definition
nonrandom
sequences
can
be
compressed
One
basic
principle
of
compression
is
that
if
you
can
predict
what
is
coming
next
you
can
compress
effectively
The
reason
that
sequences
such
as
0
0
0
0
and
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday
Sunday
Monday
are
so
effectively
compressible
andconcomitantlyfar
339from
random
is
that
it
is
simple
to
decide
what
the
successor
of
any
element
is
Even
sequences
for
which
it
is
not
possible
to
decide
unambiguously
what
the
next
element
is
can
be
compressed
if
some
indications
are
available
It
is
not
even
necessary
that
the
rules
be
supplied
up
front
as
they
can
be
for
sequences
such
as
0
0
0
0
and
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday
Thursday
Friday
Saturday
Sunday
Monday
The
rules
and
statistics
of
prediction
of
a
successor
can
be
generated
on
the
fly
from
the
incoming
data
The
rule
the
weather
tomorrow
is
likely
to
be
the
same
as
the
weather
today
wouldin
most
placesbe
good
enough
for
effective
compression
of
a
series
of
daily
weather
reports
Putting
together
these
considerations
suggests
a
general
idea
that
the
harder
it
is
to
predict
the
contents
of
a
data
set
from
a
subset
of
the
data
the
more
complex
the
data
set
is
The
relationships
among
complexity
predictability
compressibility
and
randomness
which
we
have
so
far
described
for
character
strings
apply
to
the
static
structures
of
other
types
of
objects
including
images
threedimensional
structures
andespeciallynetworks
Indeed
most
types
of
biological
data
can
be
regarded
as
networks
For
instance
a
nucleotide
sequence
is
equivalent
to
a
network
in
which
the
individual
bases
are
the
nodes
and
each
base
is
connected
by
a
directed
edge

Thats
a
perfectly
proper
graph
Conversely
recognizing
that
sequences
are
networks
can
usefully
lead
us
to
ask
can
we
define
analogues
of
sequence
alignment
for
more
general
networks
Yes
we
can
Complexity
of
other
types
of
biological
data
Many
types
of
biological
data
are
not
sequences
These
include
static
data
such
as
protein
structures
5
gene
expression
patterns
measured
with
microarrays
and
regulatory
networks
and
dynamic
data
describing
processes
For
static
data
generalizations
of
Kolmogorovs
approach
are
suitable
for
defining
complexity
The
description
of
the
complexity
of
a
process
is
more
difficult
Computational
complexity
Perhaps
the
bestdeveloped
area
of
analysis
of
complexity
of
processes
comes
from
studies
of
the
complexities
of
computational
problems
An
algorithm
in
computer
science
defines
a
process
for
solving
a
computational
problem
For
some
problems
the
execution
time
required
to
solve
it
is
directly
proportional
to
the
size
of
the
problem
These
are
said
to
be
of
order
O
N
read
OhN
For
instance
searching
for
a
number
in
an
unsorted
table
requires
an
execution
time
proportional
to
the
length
N
of
the
table
O
N
For
some
problems
the
execution
time
increases
only
as
N
log
N
Sorting
a
list
is
an
O
N
log
N
problem
For
some
problems
the
execution
time
increases
as
a
power
N

or
N
3
or
The
alignment

dynamic
programming
see
Chapter
5
of
two
sequences
both
of
length
N
by
dynamic
programming
is
an
O
N
2
problem
These
are
called
polynomialtime
problems
Still
other
problems
have
even
greater
time
demands
Enumerating
all
subsets
of
a
set
containing
N
members
is
O

N
Computer
scientists
define
the
complexity
of
a
problem
in
terms
of
the
dependence
of
execution
time
on
problem
size
see
Box
75
In
principle
constraints
of
computational
complexity
apply
to
biological
systems
much
as
to
any
other
kind
of
computer
Computational
complexity
describes
the
complexity
of
the
problem
not
the
complexity
of
the
device
that
solves
it
However
classical
computational
complexity
theory
applies
to
computers
that
execute
programs
sequentially
Biological
computers
do
lots
of
parallel
processing
This
allows
them
to
solve
problems
of
substantial
complexity
For
instance
the
regulatory
activities
340that
biological
systems
carry
out
are
complicated
nonlinear
optimization
calculations
Prediction
of
protein
structure
from
amino
acid
sequence
is
an
example
Another
described
by
Sydney
Brenner
is
the
growth
of
bacteria
in
heavy
water
Changing
from
H
2
O
to
D
2
O
has
the
effect
of
changing
the
kinetic
constants
of
many
enzymatic
reactions
After
a
relatively
short
period
cells
readjust
and
resume
activity
and
growth
Would
you
call
this
stability
or
robustness
Static
and
dynamic
complexity
One
dimension
of
complexity
is
time
Is
it
possible
to
distinguish
static
from
dynamic
complexity
If
we
could
define
and
measure
the
static
complexity
of
a
system
this
would
provide
an
approach
to
dynamic
complexity
we
could
ask
how
the
static
complexity
of
a
system
changes
with
time
For
example
a
program
that
sorts
a
list
of
numbers
into
order
may
proceed
through
a
series
of
steps
Box

Classes

and

A
problem
that
can
be
solved
in
polynomial
time
is
said
to
be
in
class
P
O
N
log
N
algorithms
are
faster
than
O
N
2
and
are
therefore
in
class
P
Suppose
on
the
other
hand
that
the
optimal
algorithm
to
solve
a
problem
has
order
worse
than
polynomial
for
instance
it
might
have
exponential
order
O
2
N
but
that
if
you
propose
a
solution
it
can
be
checked
in
polynomial
time
Such
a
problem
is
said
to
be
of
class
NP
NP
does
not
stand
for
nonpolynomial
but
for
nondeterministic
polynomial
referring
to
a
different
model
for
the
computation
Dont
worry
about
this
technical
distinction
Consider
the
problem
of
sorting
a
list
of
numbers
into
order
That
is
given
a
series
of
N
numbers2

an
algorithm
must
produce
as
output
the
numbers
rearranged
into

3
4
5
7

Whatever
the
order
of
the
optimal
algorithm
that
solves
the
problem
an
algorithm
to
verify
that
1

is
a
solution
or
that
1

4

3
is
not
a
solution
can
run
in
time
linear
in
the
length
of
the
list
It
is
necessary
only
to
check
that
each
number
is
greater
than
or
equal
to
its
predecessor
which
can
be
done
by
looking
at
each
element
of
the
list
once
Therefore
sorting
a
list
of
numbers
into
order
is
a
problem
in
class
NP
Sorting
happens
also
to
be
in

For

we

whether

Many
NP
problems
have
equivalent
complexities
in
the
sense
that
if
a
polynomial
algorithm
were
discovered
for
one
it
could
be
applied
to
solve
others
The
set
of
NPcomplete
problems
is
the
set
of
NP
problems
such
that
if
we
could
solve
any
one
of
them
in
polynomial
time
we
would
be
able
to
solve
all
of
them
in
polynomial
time
In
other
words
the
discovery
of
a
polynomialtime
algorithm
for
any
problem
known
to
be
NP
complete
would
cause
the
classes
P
and
NPcomplete
to
coalesce
But
are
there
any
NP
problems
that
are
not
in

This
is

that
the

of
an

of

order
for

of

proving
it
to
be

would
show
that
all

are
of

or
If

P
would
expand
to
fill
the
entire
class
NP
set
in
which
the
numbers
appear
ordered
to
progressively
greater
extents
The
randomness
of
the
list
may
steadily
decrease
This
provides
an
important
connection
between
complexity
of
static
data
and
complexity
of
process
We
can
collect
the
historical
records
of
a
process
and
treat
them
as
a
succession
of
cases
of
static
data
We
can
apply
ideas
of
predictability
and
complexity
of
structures
to
these
historical
records
to
give
insight
into
the
changes
in
complexity
of
the
system
during
the
process
For
real
physical
processes
changes
in
complexity
over
time
appear
to
be
governed
by
some
general
rules
If
you
stop
people
on
the
street
some
of
them
might
well
say
that
in
closed
systems
the
laws
of
thermodynamics
require
that
structural
complexity
always
increases
in
natural
processes
Others
might
say
that
the
solar
system
is
structurally
complex
but
ignoring
tidal
effects
dynamically
simple
Will
these
statements
hold
up
to
rigorous
analysis
Within
classical
Newtonian
mechanics
we
could
base
an
analysis
of
dynamic
complexity
on
the
definition
and
description
of
the
trajectories
of
a
system
of
particles
The
initial
positions
and
velocities
of
the
particles
knowledge
of
the
forces
between
them
and
Newtons
laws
of
motion
together
provide
a
concise
description
of
the
dynamics
of
such
a
system
However
even
within
the
framework
of
classical
dynamics
this
concise
description
can
break
down
in
the
case
of
chaotic
states
In
chaotic
states
very
small
changes
in
the
initial
conditions
can
lead
to
very
large
changes
in
the
ensuing
trajectories
Prediction
of
the
dynamics
requires
very
precise
statement
of
the
initial
conditions
and
very
precise
knowledge
of
the
forces
Specification
of
the
information
required
to
describe
the
dynamics
cannot
in
these
cases
be
concise
Chaos
is
an
extreme
form
of
dynamic
complexity
6
Another
way
to
look
at
this
is
directly
relevant
to
systems
biology
the
dynamics
of
nonchaotic
systems
are
robust
to
small
changes
in
initial
conditions
The
dynamics
of
chaotic
systems
are
not
robust
to
small
changes
in
initial
conditions
Chaos
and
predictability
The
discovery
of
the
laws
of
mechanics
in
the
17th
centuryNewtons
Principia
was
published
in
1687gave
rise
to
the
hope
that
the
dynamics
of
the
solar
system
in
particular
and
much
if
not
all
of
the
universe
in
general
was
predictable
Laplace
expressed
the
view
that
If
we
can
imagine
a
consciousness
great
enough
to
know
the
exact
locations
and
velocities
of
all
the
objects
in
the
universe
at
the
present
instant
as
well
as
all
forces
then
there
could
be
no
secrets
from
this
consciousness
It
could
calculate
anything
about
the
past
or
future
from
the
laws
of
cause
and
effect
Leaving
aside
philosophical
questions
of
the
implications
about
free
will
and
responsibility
there
are
also
issues
of
computability
How
much
information
do
we
really
need
and
how
accurately
do
342we
need
it
to
predict
the
dynamics
of
the
solar
system
The
weather
The
universe
In
chaotic
systems
accurate
prediction
of
the
dynamic
development
requires
unachievably
accurate
knowledge
of
the
initial
conditions
At
the
atomic
level
Heisenbergs
uncertainty
principle
killed
off
Laplaces
hope
of
perfect
determinism
It
is
true
that
in
classical
mechanics
even
chaotic
systems
are
subject
to
Poincars
recurrence
principle
any
system
of
particles
held
at
fixed
total
energy
will
eventually
return
arbitrarily
closely
to
any
set
of
initial
positions
and
velocities
What
rescues
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
is
that
the
closer
the
reapproach
demanded
the
longer
the
time
required
that
is
the
rarer
the
fluctuations
that
achieve
the
recurrence
However
knowing
that
the
configuration
will
recur
does
not
simplify
the
calculation
of
the
trajectories
of
the
particles
Through
unpredictability
chaotic
dynamics
is
associated
with
complexity
However
chaotic
dynamics
is
not
entirely
incompatible
with
order
and
even
the
spontaneous
generation
of
order
In
governing
the
time
course
of
evolution
of
a
system
chaotic
dynamics
does
sometimes
produce
stable
states
or
approximations
to
stable
states
these
are
called
attractors
Sometimes
these
are
unique
points
in
other
cases
they
are
periodic
andor
localized
states
There
have
been
examples
of
apparent
generation
of
order
in
model
systems
evolving
at
the
edge
of
chaos
There
are
even
examples
of
static
or
structural
order
in
chaotic
systems
Many
sequences
associated
with
chaotic
behaviour
have
a
fractal
structure
This
means
that
if
an
object
is
dissected
into
parts
the
parts
have
a
structure
similar
to
that
of
the
whole
as
well
as
to
one
another
B
Mandelbrot
has
produced
many
familiar
beautiful
images
This
selfsimilarity
at
different
scales
implies
that
if
we
know
part
of
such
a
structure
we
can
predict
a
larger
segment
of
it
This
should
recall
the
idea
that
predictability
should
permit
compressibility
and
effectively
reduce
complexity
Indeed
such
internal
structural
relationships
have
been
applied
to
compression
Fractal
image
compression
is
an
effective
tool
for
reducing
the
sizes
of
images
to
a
form
from
which
the
recovered
image
is
not
exactly
the
same
as
the
starting
image
but
perceptually
equivalent
Fractal
structures
in
biology
include
branching
patterns
of
plants
and
of
the
circulatory
systems
of
vertebrates
At
the
molecular
level
the
storage
polysaccharide
glycogen
has
features
of
a
fractal
structure

Problem
74
Suppose
you
want
a
program
to
identify
whether
a
certain
passage
of
text
no
fewer
than
200
words
in
length
is
in
English
French
or
German
You
are
given
sample
texts
of
comparable
length
known
to
be
in
each
of
those
languages
Of
course
you
could
scan
the
unknown
text
for
its
alphabet
the
presence
of
would
imply
French
the
presence
of
would
imply
German
and
the
absence
of
both
would
imply
English
Or
you
could
look
for
words
and
implies
English
le
implies
French
and
der
or
das
but
not
die
or
den
or
even
in
Brooklyn
dem
implies
German
However
these
might
fail
in
the
case
of
text
primarily
in
one
language
but
quoting
a
short
passage
in
one
of
the
others
Think
of
a
method
based
on
compression
of
the
concatenation
of
the
unknown
text
with
each
of
the
knowns
Your
method
should
require
no
knowledge
whatsoever
of
the
alphabet
or
vocabulary
of
each
of
the
languages
Indeed
it
should
work
even
if
the
languages
of
the

were
unidentified
and
unrecognized
For

there

345Metabolic
pathways
LEARNING
GOALS
To
recognize
that
metabolic
networks
of
any
organism
correspond
to
graphs
in
which
metabolites
are
the
nodes
and
reactions
connecting
them
are
the
edges
Enzymes
label
the
edges
that
correspond
to
the
reactions
they
catalyse
To
understand
that
comparisons
of
metabolic
pathways
in
different
species
shows
regions
of
core
overlap
Some
pathways
are
special
to
certain
groups
of
organisms
For
instance
the
CalvinBenson
cycle
for
fixation
of
carbon
dioxide
does
not
appear
in
almost
any
animals

classifications
of
the
functions
of
biological
molecules
In
what
ways
are
they
similar
In
what
ways
do
they
differ
To
appreciate
the
importance
of
accurate
annotation
of
enzyme
function
in
databases
To
recognize
that
transfer
of
annotation
among
homologous
proteins
is
by
far
the
easiest
way
to
proceed
but
in
the
absence
of
experimental
confirmation
it
is
not
trustworthy
To
appreciate
the
physicochemical
basis
of
enzymatic
catalysis
and
the
quantities
needed
to
characterize
their
kinetics
Such
information
is
necessary
if
we
are
to
consider
modelling
flows
through
metabolic
networks
To
understand
how
enzymes
develop
modified
or
novel
functions
General
categories
are
recruitment
divergence
and
mixing
and
matching
of
domains
To
see
how
the
algorithms
for
comparison
of
nucleic
acid
and
amino
acid
sequences
can
be
generalized
to
compare
metabolic
pathways
To
become
familiar
with
databases
of
metabolic
networks
A
metabolite
is
a
molecule
that
undergoes
transformation
in
a
biological
system
either
under
the
action
of
enzymatic
catalysis
or
by
spontaneous
reaction
It
is
conventional
to
think
of
metabolites
as
small
molecules
such
as
simple
sugars
or
amino
acids
rather
than
proteins
and
nucleic
acids
but
the
distinction
is
arbitrary
Metabolic
pathways
are
the
road
maps
defining
the
possible
transformations
of
metabolites
They
form
a
network
representable
as
a
graph
Usually
the
metabolites
are
the
nodes
and
reactions
connecting
them
are
the
edges
Irreversible
reactions
correspond
to
directed
edges
The
enzyme
that
catalyses
each
reaction
labels
the
edge
See
Weblem
81
To
compile
a
metabolic
network
we
need
to
know
the
possible
reactions
that
can
occur
and
we
need
to
know
the
catalytic
activities
of
all
the
enzymes
These
sets
of
data
are
really
two
sides
of
the
same
coin
Generations
of
biochemists
have
charted
metabolic
pathways
These
are
fairly
comprehensive
for
the
beststudied
organisms
which
include
E
coli
yeast
rat
and
human
A
sizable
fraction
of
the
pathways
are
common
and
in
many
cases
the
enzymes
that
catalyse
corresponding
reactions
are
homologous
over
a
broad
range
of
species
Indeed
this
often
provides
the
most
direct
route
to
establishing
the
metabolic
pathway
network
of
a
lesswellstudied
organism
Working
out
the
346individual
reactions
using
classical
methods
such
as
following
radioactive
tracers
remains
very
labourintensive
It
is
much
easier
to
sequence
the
genome
infer
the
amino
acid
sequences
of
the
enzymes
look
for
sequences
similar
to
enzymes
of
known
function
and
assemble
the
metabolic
networks
from
the
assignable
enzymatic
functions
When
this
works
it
is
golden
The
problem
is
that
it
often
fails
Clearly
the
basic
infrastructure
of
this
enterprise
involves
knowing
the
functions
of
enzymes
To
impose
some
order
on
this
information
there
have
been
several
attempts
to
classify
enzyme
function
Classification
and
assignment
of
protein
function
The
Enzyme
Commission
The
first
detailed
classification
of
protein
functions
was
that
of
the
Enzyme
Commission
EC
In
1955
the
General
Assembly
of
the
International
Union
of
Biochemistry
IUB
in
consultation
with
the
International
Union
of
Pure
and
Applied
Chemistry
IUPAC
established
an
International
Commission
on
Enzymes
to
systematize
nomenclature
The
EC
published
its
classification
scheme
first
on
paper
and
now
on
the
web
httpwwwchemqmulacukiubmbenzyme
EC
numbers
looking
suspiciously
like
a
computers
IP
number
contain
four
fields
corresponding
to
a
fourlevel
hierarchy
For
example
EC
1111
corresponds
to
alcohol
dehydrogenase
catalysing
the
general
reaction
Several
reactions
involving
different
alcohols
would
share
this
number
but
the
same
dehydrogenation
of
one
of
these
alcohols
by
an
enzyme
using
the
alternative
cofactor
NADP
would
be
assigned
EC
1112
The
first
field
in
an
EC
number
indicates
one
of
the
six
main
divisions
classes
to
which
the
enzyme
belongs
Class
1
Oxidoreductases
Class
2
Transferases
Class
3
Hydrolases
Class
4
Lyases
Class
5
Isomerases
Class
6
Ligases
The
significance
of
the
second
and
third
numbers
depends
on
the
class
For
oxidoreductases
the
second
number
describes
the
substrate
and
the
third
number
the
acceptor
For
transferases
the
second
number
describes
the
class
of
item
transferred
and
the
third
number
describes
either
more
specifically
what
they
transfer
or
in
some
cases
the
acceptor
For
hydrolases
the
second
number
signifies
the
kind
of
bond
cleaved
eg
an
ester
bond
and
the
third
number
the
molecular
context
eg
a
carboxylic
ester
or
a
thiolester
Proteinases
are
treated
slightly
differently
with
the
third
number
indicating
the
mechanism
serine
proteinases
thiol
proteinases
and
acid
proteinases
are
classified
separately
For
lyases
the
second
number
signifies
the
kind
of
bond
formed
eg
CC
or
CO
and
the
third
number
the
specific
molecular
context
For
isomerases
the
second
number
indicates
the
type
of
reaction
and
the
third
number
the
specific
class
of
reaction
For
ligases
the
347second
number
indicates
the
type
of
bond
formedfor
example
EC
61
for
CO
bonds
enzymes
acylating
tRNA
and
EC
62
for
CS
bonds
acylCoA
derivatives
etcand
the
third
number
the
type
of
molecule
in
which
it
appears
The
fourth
number
gives
the
specific
enzymatic
activity
Specialized
classifications
are
available
for
some
families
of
enzymes
for
instance
the
MEROPS
database
by
ND
Rawlings
and
AJ
Barrett
provides
a
structurebased
classification
of
peptidases
and
proteinases
httpmeropssangeracuk
The
EC
produced
a
catalogue
of
reactions
not
an
assignment
of
function
to
proteins
The
EC
has
emphasized
that
It
is
perhaps
worth
noting
as
it
has
been
a
matter
of
longstanding
confusion
that
enzyme
nomenclature
is
primarily
a
matter
of
naming
reactions
catalysed
not
the
structures
of
the
proteins
that
catalyse
them
httpwwwchemqmulacukiubmbnomenclature
Assigning
EC
numbers
to
proteins
is
a
separate
task
Such
assignments
appear
in
protein
databases
such
as
UniProtKB
The
Gene
Ontology
Consortium
protein
function
classification
In
1999
Michael
Ashburner
and
many
coworkers
faced
the
problem
of
annotating
the
soontobe
completed
D
melanogaster
genome
sequence
As
a
classification
of
function
the
EC
classification
was
unsatisfactory
if
only
because
it
was
limited
to
enzymes
Ashburner
organized
the
Gene
Ontology
Consortium
to
produce
a
standardized
scheme
for
describing
function
2
Recall
that
an
ontology
is
a
formal
set
of
welldefined
terms
with
welldefined
interrelationships
that
is
a
dictionary
and
rules
of
syntax
The
Gene
Ontology
Consortium
httpwwwgeneontologyorg
has
produced
a
systematic
classification
of
gene
function
in
the
form
of
a
dictionary
of
terms
and
their
relationships
As
with
the
EC
classification
GO
provides
a
catalogue
of
functions
not
an
assignment
of
function
to
particular
genes
or
proteins
Many
databases
contain
attributions
of
EC
and
GO
categories
to
individual
proteins
Organizing
concepts
of
the
GO
project
include
three
categories
1
Molecular
function
a
function
associated
with
what
an
individual
protein
or
RNA
molecule
does
in
itself
either
a
general
description
such
as
enzyme
or
a
specific
one
such
as
alcohol
dehydrogenase
This
is
function
from
the
biochemists
point
of
view
2
Biological
process
a
component
of
the
activities
of
a
living
system
mediated
by
a
protein
or
RNA
possibly
in
concert
with
other
proteins
or
RNA
molecules
either
a
general
term
such
as
signal
transduction
or
a
particular
one
such
as
cAMP
synthesis
This
is
function
from
the
cells
point
of
view
Because
many
processes
are
dependent
on
location
GO
also
tracks
3
Cellular
component
the
assignment
of
site
of
activity
or
partners
this
can
be
a
general
term
such
as
nucleus
or
a
specific
one
such
as
ribosome
An
example
of
the
GO
classification
is
shown
in
Figure
81
The
GO
schemes
are
not
strict
hierarchies
but
have
a
more
general
structure
They
form
directed
acyclic
graphs
Graphs
because
they
consist
of
nodes
connected
by
edges
Directed
because
for
any
pair
of
nodes
connected
by
an
edge
one
of
the
nodes
represents
a
more
general
class
than
the
other
so
that
more
inclusive
less
inclusive
defines
a
direction
pointing
away
from
the
root
Acyclic
means
that
any
path
that
follows
the
directions
specified
by
each
edge
cannot
reencounter
any
previous
node
in
the
path
for
this
would
contradict
the
idea
that
the
directions
of
the
edges
are
always
from
the
more
general
to
the
348more
specific

c

component
Different
places
within
the
cell
These
pictures
illustrate
the
general
structure
of
the
GO
classification
Each
term
describing
a
function
is
a
node
in
a
graph
Each
node
has
one
or
more
parents
and
one
or
more
descendants
arrows
indicate
direct
ancestordescendant
relationships
A
path
in
the
graph
is
a
succession
of
nodes
each
node
the
parent
of
the
next
Nodes
can
have
grandparents
and
more
remote
ancestors
Unlike
the
EC
hierarchy
the
GO
graphs
are
not
trees
in
the
technical
sense
because
there
can
be
more
than
one
path
from
an
ancestor
to
a
decendant
For
example
there
are
two
paths
in
a
from
enzyme
to
ATPdependent
helicase
349Along
one
path
helicase
is
the
intermediate
node
Along
the
other
path
adenosine
triphosphatase
is
the
intermediate
node
Although
the
nodes
are
shown
on
discrete
levels
to
clarify
the
structure
of
the
graph
all
the
nodes
on
any
given
level
do
not
necessarily
have
a
common
degree
of
significance
unlike
family
genus
and
species
levels
in
the
Linnaean
taxonomic
tree
or
the
ranks
in
military
industrial
or
academic
organizations
GO
terms
could
not
have
such
a
common
degree
of
significance
given
that
there
can
be
multiple
paths
of
different
lengths
between
different
nodes

350Proteomics
has
become
an
important
field
in
bioinformatics
given
the
importance
of
accurate
assignments
of
enzyme
functions
Genomics
and
proteomics
contribute
to
the
development
of
the
relevant
databases
and
also
to
the
development
of
algorithms
for
comparing
and
analysing
the
patterns
they
contain
Catalysis
by
enzymes
Enzymes
are
examples
of
proteinligand
complexes
They
bind
substrates
and
cofactors
selectively
and
in
specific
geometric
orientations
In
this
way
they
ensure
that
substrates
are
properly
juxtaposed
with
catalytic
residues
of
the
protein
For
multisubstrate
reactions
enzymes
force
the
two
substrates
to
approach
each
other
in
the
correct
orientation
for
favourable
reaction
If
the
same
molecules
free
in
solution
were
to
collide
in
random
orientation
the
probability
that
any
collision
would
result
in
a
reaction
would
be
very
low
Some
enzymecatalysed
reactions
follow
the
same
pathway
as
the
uncatalysed
reactions
but
with
lower
activation
barriers
Other
enzymes
substitute
different
reaction
mechanisms
with
intermediates
very
different
from
those
of
the

An

enzyme
will
bind
its

adequately
to
get

process
started
but
bind
the
transition
state
more
tightly
Some
enzymes
are
rigid
and
have
better
complementarity
to
the
transition
state
than
to
the
substrate
Others
undergo
conformational
changes
upon
binding
substrate
from
a
form
adapted
to
bind
the
substrate
to
one
adapted
to
bind
the

to
exclude

known
as

perhaps
10
Why
then
is
the
rest
of
the

necessary
Reasons
include
the
following
The
rest
of
the
protein
is
required
to
bring
the
active
site
residues
into
their
correct
spatial
relationship
The
active
site
residues
are
generally
distant
in
the
sequence
and
it
is
the
folding
of
the
chain
that
brings
them
into
proximity
In
many
enzyme
mechanisms
proteins
must
undergo
conformational
changes
The
entire
structure
is
needed
to
provide
the
levers
and
fulcra
for
the
mechanical
activity
In
some
proteins
active
sites
are
in
strained
conformations
The
rest
of
the
structure
must
provide
the
energy
to
stabilize
this
Coupling
of
relief
of
this
strain
to
interaction
with
a
substrate
can
enhance
binding
affinity
and
catalytic
power
Typically
the
enzyme
becomes
more
rigid
thermostable
and
proteaseresistant
with

Proteinligand

Reversible

of

to

involves

of

or
for
the

of
n
identical
ligands
to
a
single

These
do
not
exhaust
the
possibilities
Many
proteins
bind
two
or
more
different
ligands
at
the
same
time
enzymes

a

many
examples

353The
Michaelis
constant
of
an
enzyme
is
the

constant
of
the

complex
assumed
in
the
MichaelisMenten
model
to
be
at
equilibrium
with
respect
to
enzyme

see
next
section
on
Enzyme

The
K
D
is
related
to
the
Gibbs
free
energy
change
of
dissociation
by
the
relationship
in
which
the
underground
symbol
designates
a
property
of
an
agreedupon
standard
state
Assuming
no
structural
change
on
ligation
the
entropy
term
will
favour
dissociation
because
two
objects
will
have
greater
conformational
freedom
if
they
are
kinetically
independent
than
if
they
are
tethered
Therefore
to
achieve
a
stable
complex
the
enthalpy
term
must
provide
attractive
forces
adequate
to
overcome
the
intrinsic
entropic
penalty
Raising
the
temperature
which
gives
more
importance
to
the
entropy
term
will
promote
dissociation
To

Enzyme
kinetics
Kinetics
is
the
measurement
of
reaction
rates
and
their
dependence
on
conditions
including
concentrations
of
reactants
products
and
catalysts
Classically
the
measurement
of
reaction
velocity
as
a
function
of
substrate
concentration
S
involved
mixing
enzyme
and
substrate
and
following
the
reaction
by
measuring
disappearance
of
substrate
or
appearance
of
product
For
instance
the
fact
that
NADH
but
not
NAD
has
an
absorption
maximum
at
340
nm
made
it
convenient
to
follow

A
simple
model
of
an
enzymecatalysed
reaction
by
V
Henri
and
by
L
Michaelis
and
M
Menten
involves
enzyme
and
substrate
interacting
to
form
an
enzymesubstrate
complex
The
complex
breaks
down
to
release
product
and
restore
the
original
free
enzyme
where
E
is
enzyme
S
is
substrate
ES
is
the
enzymesubstrate
complex
P
is
the
product
and
k
1
k
1
and
k
2
are
rate
constants
for
the
individual
reaction
steps
S
means
the
concentration
of
substrate
E
is
the
concentration
of
enzyme
and
ES
is
the
concentration
of
enzymesubstrate
complex
More
precisely
E
is
the
concentration
of
active
sites
for
some
enzyme
molecules
may
contain
more
than
one
active
site
An
important
contribution
of
Michaelis
and
Menten
was
to
emphasize
the
determination
of
the
initial
rate
v
0
of
the
reaction
in
the
absence
of
product
In
practice
this
requires
following
the
time
course
of
the
reaction
and
extrapolating
back
to
the
moment
of
mixing
enzyme
and
substrate
There
is
also
a
transient
stage
as
the
enzyme
and
substrate
mix
and
interact
before
establishment
of
equilibrium
This
stage
lasts
only
milliseconds
It
is
observable
only
with
special
techniques
and
does
not
affect
extrapolated
inferences
of
initial
rates
Under
these
circumstances
there
is
no
back
reaction
of
product
if
only
because
there
is
no
product
there
to
backreact
This
assumption
also
avoids
certain
potentially
complicating
factors
such
as
product
inhibition
or
enzyme
degradation
which
probably
were
not
recognized
in
1913
Michaelis
and
Menten
further
assumed
that
the
forward
and
reverse
rates
of
the
first
step
are
faster
than
the
formation
of
product
that
is
k

k

picture
is

The
Michaelis
constant
K
M
has
dual
significance

it
is
the
substrate
concentration
at
which
the
initial

is
V

and
2
it
is
the

Figure

the

How
do
proteins
evolve
new
functions
Recall
that
enzymes
have
two
types
of
specificity
They
have
substrate
specificity
for
which
Fischers
lockandkey
analogy
remains
a
useful
description
They
also
have
specificity
with
respect
to
the
reaction
catalysed
Sequence
divergence
can
modify
both
types
of
specificity
while
conserving
the
basic
reaction
For
instance
humans
have
two
homologous
succinylCoA
synthases
one
linked
to
formation
of
GTP
and
the
other
to
formation
of
ATP
Although
most
biochemists
would
regard
this
as
only
a
change
in
substrate
specificity
according
to
both
EC
and
GO
they
catalyse
different
reactions
See
Weblem
86
In
other
cases
homologous
proteins
have
diverged
to
catalyse
reactions
with
different
substrates
and
products
In
some
cases
they
retain
components
of
the
mechanism

acts

Control
over
enzyme
activity
For
smooth
operation
of
metabolic
pathways
it
is
essential
to
regulate
the
panoply
of
enzymatic
activities
Discussions
of
classical
enzymology
treating
kinetics
as
we
have
just
done
would
go
on
to
discuss
regulation
of
the
velocities
of
enzymatic
reactions
by
inhibitors
and
allosteric
effectors
However
inhibitionthe

activity

only
one
of

of

As

there
are

for

Figure

There
are
many
mechanisms
and
types
of
target
for
regulation
of
enzyme
activity
These
include
control
over
expression
patterns
and
control
over
the
structures
and
activities
of
proteins
in
the
cell
For
instance
allosteric
changes
are
ligandinduced
conformational
changes
in
proteins
that
modify
activity
often
leading
to
cooperative
binding
curves
as
in
haemoglobin
Structural
mechanisms
of
evolution
of
altered
or
novel
protein
functions
Mechanisms
of
protein
evolution
that
produce
altered
or
novel
functions
include
divergence
recruitment
and
mixing
and
matching
of
domains
Divergence
In
families
of
closely
related
proteins
mutations
usually
conserve
function
but
modulate
specificity
We
have
seen
several
examples
the
trypsin
family
of
serine
proteinases
contains
a
specificity
pocket
a
surface
cleft
complementary
in
shape
and
charge
distribution
to
the
sidechain
adjacent
to
the
scissile
bond
Mutations
tend
to
leave
the
backbone
conformation
of
the
pocket
unchanged
but
to
affect
the
shape
and
charge
of
its
lining
altering
the
specificity
Malate
and
lactate
dehydrogenases
are
related
enzymes
that
catalyse
similar
reactions
They
arose
by
gene
duplication
at
an
early
stage
of
the
history
of
life
and
their
sequences
have
diverged
In
an
optimal
alignment
human
malate
and
lactate
dehydrogenases
have
20
identical
residues
Nevertheless
sitedirected
mutagenesis
showed
that
a
single
residue
change
Gln
Arg
could
change
the
specificity
of
Bacillus
stearothermophilus
lactate
dehydrogenase
to
malate
Reports
of
that
work
may
have
been
read
by
a
trichomonad
which
developed
a
malate
dehydrogenase
that
in
an
evolutionary
tree
of
these
enzymes
is
much
more
similar
to
lactate
dehydrogenases
than
to
other
malate
dehydrogenases
Indeed
it
is
arguable
that
the
relationship
between
malate
and
lactate
dehydrogenases
is
really
more
a
change
in
specificity
than
a
change
in
the
reaction
But
they
do
have
different
EC
classifications
Such
families
of
enzymes
illustrate
the
kinds
of
structural
features
that
change
and
those
that
stay
the
same
In
some
cases
the
catalytic
atoms
occupy
the
same
positions
in
molecular
space
although
the
residues
that
present
them
are
located
at
different
points
in
the
fold
In
other
cases
the
positions
in
359space
of
the
catalytic
residues
are
conserved
even
though
the
identities
and
functions
of
the
catalytic
residues
vary
In
these
cases
there
appears
to
be
a
set
of
conserved
functional
positions
within
the
space
of
the
molecule
As
evolution
ventures
farther
afield
several
enzyme
families
show
an
even
greater
degree
of
divergence
The
apurinicapyrimidinic
endonuclease
superfamily
a
large
diverse
group
of
phosphoesterases
includes
members
that
cleave
DNA
and
RNA
and
lipid
phosphatases
Even
catalytic
residues
vary
between
different
subfamilies
of
this
group
For
example
a
His
essential
for
function
of
DNA
repair
enzyme
DNaseI
is
not
conserved
in
exonuclease
III
Conversely
many
functions
are
provided
by
unrelated
proteins
Chymotrypsin
and
subtilisin
have
produced
the
same
catalytic
mechanism
for
proteolysis
by
convergent
evolution

proteins

and
a

Recruitment
Many
people
ask
how
much
a
protein
must
change
its
sequence
before
its
function
changes
The
answer
is
not
at
all
There
are
numerous
examples
of
proteins
with
multiple
functions
1
Eye
lens
proteins
in
the
duck
are
identical
in
sequence
to
active
lactate
dehydrogenase
and
enolase
in
other
tissues
although
they
do
not
encounter
the
substrates
in
the
eye
They
have
been
recruited
to
provide
a
structural
and
optical
function
Several
other
avian
eye
lens
proteins
are
identical
or
similar
to
enzymes
In
some
cases
residues
essential
for
catalysis
have
mutated
proving
that
the
function
of
these
proteins
in
the
eye
is
not
enzymatic
In
those
species
the
coexistence
of
mutated
inactive
enzymes
in
the
eye
and
active
enzymes
in
other
tissues
implies
that
the
gene
must
have
been
duplicated
2
Some
proteins
interact
with
different
partners
to
produce
oligomers
with
different
functions
In
E
coli
a
protein
that
functions
on
its
own
as
lipoate
dehydrogenase
is
also
an
essential
subunit
of
pyruvate
dehydrogenase
2oxoglutarate
dehydrogenase
and
the
glycine
cleavage
complex
3
Proteinase
Do
functions
as
a
chaperone
at
low
temperatures
and
as
a
proteinase
at
high
temperatures
The
logic
apparently
is
that
under
conditions
of
moderate
stress
it
attempts
to
salvage
misfolded
proteins
under
conditions
of
higher
stress
it
gives
up
and
recycles
them
3604
The
activity
of
phosphoglucose
isomerase
neuroleukin
autocrine
motility
factor
differentiation
and
maturation
mediator
depends
on
location
This
protein
functions
as
a
glycolytic
enzyme
in
the
cytoplasm
but
as
a
nerve
growth
factor
and
cytokine
outside
the
cell
Divergence
and
recruitment
are
at
the
ends
of
a
broad
spectrum
of
changes
in
sequence
and
function
Aside
from
cases
of
pure
recruitment
such
as
the
duck
eye
lens
proteins
or
phosphoglucose
isomerase
in
which
a
protein
adopts
a
new
function
with
no
sequence
change
at
all
there
are
examples
on
the
one
hand
of
relatively
small
sequence
changes
correlated
with
very
small
function
changes
which
most
people
would
think
of
as
relatively
pure
divergence
relatively
small
sequence
changes
with
quite
large
changes
in
function
which
most
people
would
think
of
as
recruitment
but
also
many
cases
in
which
there
are
large
changes
in
both
sequence
and
function
Mixing
and
matching
of
domains
There
are
many
dehydrogenases
which
catalyse
a
large
number
of
reactions
Many
of
these
are
coupled
to
reduction
of
NAD
or
NADP
Many
are
multidomain
proteins
some
multimeric
as
well
that
contain
a
common
NADbinding
domain
with
a
range
of
partner
catalytic
domains
from
at
least
a
dozen
different
families
that
vary
with
the
reaction
catalysed
Many
other
examples
are
known
in
which
a
change
in
partners
or
even
a
change
in
order
along
the
polypeptide
chain
can
create
ablate
or
modify
catalytic
activity
It
appears
much
easier
for
protein
evolution
to
adapt
existing
structures
to
new
functions
than
to
create
a
new
folding
pattern
Domain
recombination
offers
great
opportunities
for
evolution
of
novel
functions
Domain
recombination
can
modify
catalytic
function
In
addition
the
evolution
of
many
enzymes
involves
accreting
domains
or
forming
multimers
for
regulation
of
activity
Most
allosteric
enzymes
and
also
haemoglobin
are
multidomain
proteins
or
multimers
that
achieve
control
through
coupled
changes
in
tertiary
and
quaternary
structure
It
is
quite
common
for
an
enzyme
to
appear
in
fairly
simple
form
in
prokaryotes
and
in
more
complex
form
in
eukaryotes
with
the
addition
of
domains
involved
in
regulation
of
activity
Protein
evolution
at
the
level
of
domain
assembly
Comparisons
of
protein
sequences
and
structures
confirm
that
the
domain
is
an
important
unit
of
protein
evolution
Domains
appear
in
different
proteins
in
different
combinations
Thereby
from
a
relatively
small
roster
of
domain
families
evolution
can
assemble
a
large
number
of
complete
proteins
Many
large
proteins
contain
tandem
assemblies
of
domains
which
appear
in
different
contexts
and
orders
in
different
proteins
see

Several
proteins

and

is
not
preserved
Each
module
is
a
relatively
small
compact
unit
it

The
serine
proteinases
SerPr
contain
two
halves
with
structural
similarities
which
arose
by
gene
duplication
and
divergence
but
which
are
never
seen
separately
Censuses
of
genomes
suggest
that
many
proteins
are
multimodular
Of
4401
genes
in
E
coli
287
correspond
to
proteins
containing
two
three
or
four
modules
The
structural
patterns
of
510
E
coli
enzymes
involved
in
metabolism
of
small
molecules
can
be
accounted
for
in
total
or
in
part
by
213
families
of
domains
Of
the
399
that
can
be
entirely
divided
into
known
domains
68
are
single
domain
proteins
24
contain
two
domains
and
7
three
domains
Only
four
of
the
399
have
four
five
or
six
domains
There
are
marked
preferences
for
pairing
of
different
families
of
domains
Multidomain
proteins
present
particular
problems
for
assignment
of
function
in
genome
annotation
because
the
domains
may
possess
independent
functions
modulate
one
anothers
function
or
act
in
concert
to
provide
a
single
function
that
may
depend
on
the
domain
composition
and
even
order
On
the
other
hand
in
some
cases
the
presence
of
a
particular
domain
or
combination
of
domains
is
associated
with
a
specific
function
For
example
NADbinding
domains
appear
almost
exclusively
in
dehydrogenases
Based
on
known
protein
structures
it
has
been
possible
to
define
1000
domain
superfamilies
Of
the
21
000
human
genes
almost
twothirds
contain
known
domains
The
1000
domain
superfamilies
account
for
30
000
matches
in
the
human
genes
The
population
of
domains
encoded
by
known
genes
is
unevenly
distributed
Nine
domain
superfamilies
account
for
20
of
the
matched
domains
in
human
genes

include
those

Our
discussion
so
far
has
primarily
treated
the
functions
of
individual
proteins
Let
us
now
turn
to
assembly
of
these
functions
into
networks
Databases
of
metabolic
pathways
The
full
panoply
of
metabolic
reactions
forms
a
complex
network
The
structure
of
the
network
corresponds
to
a
graph
in
which
metabolites
are
the
nodes
and
the
substrate
and
product
of
each
reaction
form
an
edge
The
dynamics
of
the
network
depend
on
the
flow
capacities
of
the
individual
links
analogous
to
traffic
patterns
on
the
streets
of
a
city
Some
patterns
within
the
metabolic
network
are
linear
pathways
Others
form
closed
loops
such
as
the
Krebs
tricarboxylic
acid
cycle
Many
pathways
are
highly
branched
and
interlock
densely
However
metabolic
networks
also
contain
recognizable
clusters
or
blocks
for
instance
catabolic
and
anabolic
reactions
form
clustered
subnetworks
There
is
a
relatively
high
density
of
internal
connections
within
clusters
and
relatively
few
connections
between
them
Several
databases
contain
information
on
metabolic
pathways
in
different
organisms
They
organize
this
information
collecting
it
within
a
coherent
and
logical
structure
with

Methionine

The
diagram
shows

of
methionine
from
L
aspartate
Methionine
inhibits

O
succinyltransferase
a
classic
example
of
feedback
control
Both
the
reaction
sequence
and
the
associated
control
mechanisms
are
embedded
in
much
larger
networks
364
The
first
step
phosphorylation
of
L
aspartate
is
common
to
the
biosynthesis
of
methionine
lysine
and
threonine
E
coli
contains
three
aspartate
kinases
encoded
by
three
separate
genes
each
specific
for
one
of
the
endproduct
amino
acids
They
catalyse
the
same
reaction
but
are
subject
to
separate
regulation
The
third
step
conversion
of
L
aspartatesemialdehyde
to
L
homoserine
is
common
to
the
methionine
and
threonine
synthesis
pathways
Two
homoserine
dehydrogenases
are
separately
encoded
Regulation
of
expression
of
the
aspartate
kinases
and
homoserine
dehydrogenases
suffices
to
control
all
three
pathways
After
synthesis
methionine
is
converted
to
S
adenosylmethionine
a
common
participant
in

S
Adenosylmethionine

the

In

a

with
an
enzyme
that

one
of

A
metabolic
pathway
in
KEGG
is
an
idealization
corresponding
to
a
large
number
of
possible
metabolic
cascades
It
can
generate
a
real
metabolic
pathway
of
a
particular
organism
by
matching
the
proteins
of
that
organism
to
enzymes
within
the
reference
pathways

enzyme
in
one
organism
would
be
referred
to
in

which
link
the
enzyme
to

ones
in
other
organisms
This
permits
analysis
of
relationships
between

metabolic
pathways
of
different
organisms
KEGG
derives
its
power
from
the
very
dense
network
of
links
among
these
categories
of
information
and
additional
links
to
many
other
databases
to
which
the
system
maintains
access
Two
examples
of
the
kinds
of
question
that
can
be
treated
by
KEGG
are
given
here
1
It
has
been
suggested
that
simple
metabolic
pathways
evolve
into
more
complex
ones
by
gene
duplication
and
subsequent
divergence
Searching
the
pathway
catalogue
for
sets
of
enzymes
that
share
a
folding
pattern
will
reveal
clusters
of
linked
paralogues

KEGG
can
take
the
set
of
enzymes
from
some
organism
and
check
whether
they
can
be
integrated
into
known
metabolic
pathways
A
gap
in
a
pathway
suggests
a
missing
enzyme
or
an
unexpected
alternative
pathway
The
archaeal
shikimate
kinase
not
homologous
to
its
bacterial
counterparts
is
an
example
See
next
section
Evolution
and
phylogeny
of
metabolic
pathways
Most
organisms
share
many
common
metabolic
pathways
But
there
are
many
individual
variations
Pathway
comparison
Of
particular
interest
for
comparative
genomics
are
facilities
to
compare
pathways
among
different
organisms
Alignment
and
comparison
of
pathways
can
expose
how
pathways
have
diverged
between
species
Even
if
the
pathways
are
the
same
in
some
cases
the
enzymes
are
nonhomologous
Pathway
comparison
can
be
useful
for
annotation
of
genomes
It
is
often
possible
to
assign
function
to
proteins
on
the
basis
of
similarity
to
sequences
of
proteins
of
known
function
in
other
organisms
However
sometimes
there
are
several
weak
similarities
to
other
proteins
and
it
is
unclear
which
is
the
true
homologue
Conversely
sometimes
an
organism
has
a
metabolic
pathway
but
no
annotated
enzyme
for
an
essential
step
Confronting
the
unannotated
proteins
with
the
unassigned
functions
can
sometimes
identify
the
protein
that
fills
the
gap
in
the
pathway
If
an
enzyme
needed
for
a
pathway
cannot
be
identified
even
by
weak
sequence
similarity
it
may
be
that
the
organism
has
evolved
a
nonhomologous
enzyme
for
the
task
For
example
the
archaeon
M
jannaschii
has
a
pathway
for
biosynthesis
of
chorismate
from
4dehydroquinate
Enzymes
for
most
of
the
steps
have
homologues
in
bacteria
andor
eukaryotes
However
shikimate
kinase
was
not
identifiable
from
sequence
similarity
Because
the
metabolic
pathway
is
not
interrupted
M
jannaschii
must
have
some
protein
with
this
function
How
can
it
be
found
Although
in
bacteria
genes
consecutive
in
pathways
are
often
consecutive
in
operons
in
the
genome
this
is
not
true
of
M
jannaschii
However
the
genes
for
successive
steps
of
the
chorismate
367biosynthesis
pathway
are
clustered
and
consecutive
in
another
archaeon
Aeropyrum
pernix
It
was
possible
to
propose
a
gene
for
a
shikimate
kinase
in
A
pernix
and
to
identify
a
homologue
of
that
gene
in
M
jannaschii
Experiment
confirmed
the
prediction
that
the
M
jannaschii
gene
so
identified
MJ1440
encodes
a
shikimate
kinase
It
has
no
sequence
similarity
to
bacterial
or
eukaryotic
shikimate
kinases
A
protein
from
a
different
family
has
been
recruited
for
the
archaeal
pathway

students
includes
the
conversion
of
2oxoglutarate
aka
ketoglutarate
to

The
cyanobacterial
Krebs
cycle
is
after
all
a
relatively
minor
variation
on
a
very
common
theme
In
more
extreme
cases
organisms
have
metabolic
competence
that
is
completely
absent
from
others
We
expect
plants
but
not
humans
to
have
enzymes
for
reactions
involved
in
photosynthesis
and
cell
wall
formation
Some
organisms
achieve
the
same
overall
metabolic
transformation
but
use
alternative
pathways
that
is
different
sets
of
intermediates
For
instance
classical
glycolysis
the
EmbdenMeyerhof
pathway
and
the
EntnerDoudoroff
pathway
are
alternative
routes
from
glucose
to
pyruvate

Often
organisms
will
share
many
steps
in
a
metabolic

some
will

In
addition
to
the
differences
in
the
sequence
of
metabolitesthat
is
in
the
pathwaythe
enzymes
that
catalyse
even
the
same
reactions
are
almost
always
not
homologues
of
bacterial
or
eukaryotic
ones
The
M
jannaschii
shikimate
kinase
is
an
example
of
this
Many

ADP
or
even

The

are
also
not
retained
in
the

Alignment
of
metabolic
pathways
Metabolic
pathways
provide
interesting
examples
of
the
generalization
of
ideas
of
alignment
from
sequences
to
more
general
networks
Alignment
of
two
or
more
character
strings
is
the
assignment
of
correspondences
between
371positions
in
the
strings
usually
preserving
the
relative
order
The
constraint
that
relative
order
must
be
conserved
means
that
is
an
allowable
alignment
but
is
not
The
concept
of
alignment
including
the
relativeorder
constraint
carries
over
fairly
directly
to
protein
structures
because
of
the
linear
chemistry
of
the
polypeptide
chain
a
structural
alignment
is
still
a
correspondence
between
the
amino
acid
sequences
despite
an
appeal
to
threedimensional
data
to
determine
it
An
exception
would
be
the
case
of
two
multidomain
proteins
composed
of
homologous
domains
in
different
order
However
many
objects
of
interest
in
bioinformatics
have
a
fundamentally
nonlinear
structure
These
include
the
most
general
networks
such
as
sets
of
regulatory
interactions
among
transcription
factors
How
does
the
concept
of
alignment
generalize
Metabolic
pathways
are
an
interesting
example
Some
present
themselves
as
linear
sequences
others
are
higherdimensional
The
alignments
discussed
deal
with
a
static
and
nonquantitative
picture
of
metabolic
networks
Either
a
transformation
is
possible
or
it
is
not
It
is
entirely
possible
that
enzymes
that
catalyse
corresponding
steps
in
the
networks
have
very
different
kinetic
constants
in
two
species
or
are
subject
to
different
kinds
of
regulation
In
this
case
the
dynamic
patterns
of
traffic
through
the
networks
might
be
quite
different
even
if
the
topologies
of
the
networks
are
the
same
That
is
the
graphs
are
isomorphic
Think
of
the
difference
in
traffic
flow
through
a
city
during
rush
hour
and
at
midnight
The

changed

Comparing
linear
metabolic
pathways
Many
linear
metabolic
pathways
are
extractable
from
general
metabolic
networks
In
principle
alignment
of
linear
metabolic
pathways
is
directly
analogous
to
alignment
of
any
other
sequences
The
extension
to
alignment
of
nonlinear
metabolic
pathways
takes
us
out
of
our
comfort
zone
How
we
characterize
steps
in
metabolic
pathways
depends
on
the
kinds
of
questions
we
want
to
explore
In
its
simplest
form
a
metabolic
pathway
is
a
sequence
of
metabolites
Associated
with
each
step
in
each
organism
is
an
enzyme
Associated
with
each
enzyme
is
a
gene
In
some
cases
for
example
the
tryptophan
synthesis
pathway
in
E
coli
the
genes
for
successive
steps
of
the
pathway
are
collinear
in
the
genome
with
the
steps
of
the
pathway
see
Fig
21
Alignment
methods
can
detect
this
In
studies
of
evolution
of
metabolic
pathways
it
also
is
useful
to
associate
cofactors
with
reactions
Well
known
to
biochemistry
students
is
the
succinylCoA
synthetase
reaction
converting
succinyl
CoA
to
succinate
in
the
Krebs
cycle
The
reaction
is
coupled
to
phosphorylation
of
GDP
in
mammals
and
ADP
in
bacteria
and
plants
Some
differences
in
pathways
between
organisms
are
common
knowledge
A
vitamin
is
by
definition
not
the
product
of
a
metabolic
pathway
Humans
and
other
primates
require
a
diet
containing
vitamin
C
because
we
cannot
synthesize
it
Most
animals
can
synthesize
vitamin
C
All
372those
animals
that
cannot
do
so
lack
the
enzyme
L
gulanolactone
oxidase
which
catalyses
the
last
step
in
the
pathway
the
conversion
of
L
gluonate
to
vitamin
C
From
the
point
of
view
of
alignment
of
metabolic
sequences
the
pathway
in
humans
is
truncated
relative
to
that
of
animals
such
as
the
mouse
that
are
competent
to
synthesize
vitamin
C
In
primates
there
is
a
deletion
of
a
large
component
of
the
gene
for
L
gulanolactone
oxidase

The
much
lower
solubility
of
uric
acid
relative
to
allantoin
creates
clinical
problems
in
humans
including
kidney
stones
and
gout
The
drug
allopurinol
inhibits
xanthine
oxidase
the
enzyme
that
converts
hypoxanthine
xanthine
uric
acid
The
precursors
hypoxanthine
and
xanthine
are
more
soluble
than
uric
acid
and
are
cleared
much
faster
by
the
kidneys
Moreover
in
a
mixture
of
hypoxanthine
xanthine
and
uric
acid
each
solute
has
independent
solubility
Therefore
formation
of
a
precipitate
is
less
likely
from
a
mixed
solution
of
hypoxanthine
xanthine
and
uric
acid
than
from
a
solution
of
the
same
total
concentration
of
uric
acid
alone
The
enzyme
hypoxanthineguanine
phosphoribosyltransferase
HGPRT
recovers
degraded
purines
for
nucleic
acid
synthesis
It
converts
hypoxanthine
and
guanine

Comparing
nonlinear
metabolic
pathways
the
pentose
phosphate
pathway
and
the
CalvinBenson
cycle
373The
pentose
phosphate
pathway
and
the
CalvinBenson
cycle
in
photosynthesis
are
two
metabolic
pathways
involving
transformations
of
sugars
Metabolism
of
glucose
can
proceed
through
glycolysis
and
the
Krebs
cycle
to
couple
glucose
oxidation
to
production
of
ATP
The
pentose
phosphate
pathway
is
an
alternative
which
produces
NADPH
and
ribose5phosphate
A
cell
that
needs
reducing
power
or
ribose5phosphate
for
nucleic
acid
synthesis
will
divert
some
of
its
glucose
metabolism
through
the
pentose
phosphate
pathway
Several
intermediates
in
the
pentose
phosphate
pathway
can
be
shuttled
back
into
glycolysis
The
CalvinBenson
cycle
is
the
route
of
carbon
dioxide
fixation
in
photosynthesis
The
enzyme
ribulose15bisphosphate
carboxylase
RUBISCO
couples
carbon
dioxide
to
ribulose15
bisphosphate
to
form
an
intermediate
that
breaks
down
spontaneously
to
two
molecules
of
glyceraldehyde3phosphate
Of
every
six
molecules
of
glyceralde3phosphate
produced
five
are
used
to
reconstitute
three
molecules
of
ribulose15bisphosphate
and
the
sixth
is
harvested
for
energy
Five

The

and

each

Dynamics
of
metabolic
networks
We
have
discussed
metabolic
networks
as
static
objects
They
differ
between
species
but
for
any
organism
in
any
particular
physiological
state
at
any
particular
instant
they
are
fixed
What
about
the
dynamics
What
can
we
say
about
the
traffic
patterns
in
the
network
What
about
the
response
of
the
network
to
changing
conditions
Is
it
robust
If
it
is
how
is
this
accomplished
375Robustness
of
metabolic
networks
In
principle
networks
can
achieve
robustness
through
an
extension
of
the
mechanism
by
which
redundancy
confers
stability
The
most
direct
approach
is
simple
substitutional
redundancy
if
two
proteins
are
each
capable
of
doing
a
job
knock
out
one
and
the
other
takes
over
In
the
London
Underground
this
would
correspond
to
a
second
line
running
over
the
same
route
For
instance
when
the
Circle
line
is
not
running
passengers
travelling
between
Paddington
and
Kings
Cross
stations
can
use
the
Hammersmith
and
City
line
that
runs
on
the
same
tracks
In
yeast
for
example
singlegene
knockouts
of
over
80
of
the
6200
open
reading
frames
are
survivable
injuries
Some
duplicated
genes
contribute
to
substitutional
redundancy
For
example
in
studying
animal
models
for
diabetes
it
appears
that
mice
and
rats
but
not
humans
have
two
similar
but
nonallelic
insulin
genes
Substitutional
redundancy
requires
equivalence
not
only
of
function
but
of
expression
levels
In
the
mouse
knocking
out
either
insulin
gene
leads
to
compensatory
increased
expression
of
the
other
producing
a
normal
phenotype
Coordinated
expression
patterns
are
more
probable
among
duplicated
genes
than
among
unrelated
ones
For
example
E
coli
contains
two
fructose16bisphosphate
aldolases
One
expressed
only
in
the
presence
of
special
nutrients
is
nonessential
under
normal
growth
conditions
However
the
other
is
essential
In
this
case
functional
redundancy
does
not
provide
robustness
These
two
enzymes
are
probably
homologous
but
if
so
they
are
very
distant
relatives
not
the
product
of
a
recent
gene
duplication
One
is
a
member
of
a
family
of
fructose16bisphosphate
aldolases
typical
of
bacteria
and
eukaryotes
whereas
the
other
is
a
member
of
another
family
that
occurs
in
archaea
E
coli
is
unusual
in
containing
both
An
alternative
mechanism
of
network
robustness
is
distributed
redundancy
equivalent
effects
achieved
through
different
routes
In
normal
E
coli
approximately
twothirds
of
the
NADPH
produced
in
metabolism
arises
via
the
pentose
phosphate
shunt
which
requires
the
enzyme
glucose
6phosphate
dehydrogenase
Knocking
out
the
gene
for
this
enzyme
leads
to
metabolic
shifts
after
which
increased
levels
of
NADH
produced
by
the
Krebs
cycle
are
converted
to
NADPH
by
a
transhydrogenase
reaction
The
growth
rate
of
the
knockout
strain
is
comparable
to
that
of
the
parent
Dynamic
modelling
of
metabolism
Can
we
model
the
dynamics
of
a
metabolic
network
What
would
it
mean
to
do
so
A
challenge
that
mightnaivelyappear
relatively
simple
would
be
to
predict
the
effect
of
knocking
out
an
enzyme
An
easy
guess
would
be
to
expect
a
build
up
of
the
substrate
of
the
missing
enzyme
However
if
the
metabolic
pathways
branch
in
the
vicinity
of
that
metabolite
the
consequences
of
a
knockout
are
more
complex
For
example
the
disease
phenylketonuria
results
most
commonly
from
a
specific
dysfunctional
ie
knockedout
enzyme
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
The
normal
function
of
phenylalanine
hydroxylase
is
to
convert
phenylalanine
to
tyrosine
In
phenylketonuria
phenylalanine
does
indeed
build
up
However
the
excess
phenylalanine
is
converted
by
phenylalanine
transaminase
to
phenylpyruvic
acid
Both
compounds
accumulate
As
phenylpyruvic
acid
is
less
readily
absorbed
by
the
kidneys
than
376phenylalanine
it
is
excreted
into
the
urine
giving
the
disease
its
name
Phenylalanine
is
not
a
ketone
The
Guthrie
test
for
phenylketonuria
measures
the
concentration
of
phenylpyruvic
acid
in
the
blood
of
newborns
A
challenge
greater
than
predicting
the
effect
of
a
single
knockout
would
be
to
simulate
the
entire
metabolic
networkgiven
an
initial
set
of
metabolite
concentrationsto
predict
the
concentrations
as
a
function
of
time
The
idea
would
be
to
combine
predictions
of
the
rates
of
individual
reactions
assuming
a
simple
model
such
as
MichaelisMenten
kinetics
or
more
complex
models
of
allosteric
enzymes
This
requires
knowing
accurately
the
kinetic
constants
of
all
of
the
enzymes
including
the
consequences
of
inhibitors
and
effectors
It
requires
being
able
to
give
a
sensible
treatment
of
the
idea
of
substrate
concentration
within
a
cell
divided
into
compartments
and
to
deal
with
questions
of
rates
of
diffusion
in
a
crowded
intercellular
environment
Longerterm
simulation
would
require
knowing
the
kinetics
of
transcription
regulation
for
which
no
simple
model
analogous
to
the
MichaelisMenten
equation
is
available
There
are
also
serious
computational
issues
involving
how
precisely
the
kinetic
parameters
must
be
known
and
the
extent
to
which
simplifying
assumptions
for
instance
the
steadystate
approximationare
justified
Accurate
simulation
of
metabolic
patterns
of
entire
cells
is
a
clear
target
for
research
in
the
field
However
it
is
quite
a
daunting
challenge
and
a
very
longterm
goal
The
hope
is
to
find
pieces
of
the
general
problem
that
are
both
interesting
and
tractable
Efforts
have
included
the
following
Attempts
at
detailed
numerical
analysis
of
simple
networks
For
instance
a
simulation
of
the
asparate
threonine
pathway
see
Fig
89
in
E
coli
represented
the
enzymatic
transformations
and
feedback
inhibition
as
a
set
of
coupled
equations
4
Changes
in
expression
pattern
were
not
included
Steadystate
solutions
were
compared
with
experimental
measurements
on
cell
extracts
It
was
possible
to
simulate
the
time
course
of
threonine
synthesis
and
the
effects
of
changes
in
initial
metabolite
concentrations
predict
the
steadystate
concentrations
of
intermediates
predict
the
effects
of
changes
in
concentrations
of
individual
enzymes
on
overall
throughput
expressed
as
flux
control
coefficients
such
data
can
help
to
guide
development
of
microbial
factories
for
increased
yield
of
particular
products
the
flux
control
coefficient
is
the
percentage
change
in
flux
divided
by
the
percentage
change
in
amount
of
enzyme
It
is
not
a
property
of
the
enzyme
but
a
property
of
a
reaction
within
a
metabolic
network
A
flux
control
coefficient
equal
to
1
would
correspond
to
a
ratelimiting
step
for
different
steps
distinguish
whether
the
substrates
and
products
are
approximately
at
equilibrium
Focusing
not
on
individual
enzymes
but
on
potential
sets
of
flow
rates
The
metabolic
network
is
represent
by
a
graph
Metabolites
are
the
nodes
Edges
correspond
to
reactions
an
edge
connects
two
compounds
if
there
is
a
reaction
or
possibly
several
reactions
that
interconvert
them
The
goal
is
to
predict
the
flow
rate
through
each
edge
Recently
the
models
have
been
generalized
to
include
regulation
of
expression
There
are
general
constraints
on
the
set
of
flow
rates
under
steadystate
conditions
the
fluxes
through
each
node
must
add
up
to
0
ie
for
each
compound
the
amount
that
is
synthesized
or
supplied
externally
must
equal
the
amount
used
up
or
secreted
flux
control
coefficients
of
all
of
the
reactions
contributing
to
a
single
flux
must
add
up
to
1
the
flux
through
any
edge
is
limited
by
the
values
of
the
MichaelisMenten
parameter
V
max
for
377all
enzymes
contributing
to
the
edge
and
the
thermodynamic
properties
of
each
reaction
determine
whether
or
not
the
reaction
is
reversible
this
is
a
property
of
the
substrate
and
product
of
the
reaction
not
of
the
enzyme
the
flux
of
an
irreversible
reaction
must
be
greater
than
or
equal
to
0
It
will
be
interesting
to
see
whether
the
space
of
possible
metabolic
states
is
connected
or
broken
up
into
separated
regimens
In
general
many
possible
flow
patterns
or
metabolic
states
are
consistent
with
the
constraints
To
determine
a
single
metabolic
state
to
compare
with
experiments
it
is
possible
to
select
from
the
feasible
states
the
one
that
is
optimal
for
ATP
production
or
for
growth
rate
A
variety
of
observable
quantities
are
predictable
The
effects
of
changes
of
medium
or
gene
knockouts
which
enzymes
are
essential
for
growth
on
different
carbon
sources
What
are
limiting
factors
in
growth
What
are
maximal
theoretical
yields
of
ATP
or
assimilation
of
carbon
etc
What
are
the
fluxes
through
individual
pathways
This
is
difficult
but
not
impossible
to
measure
What
are
the
flux
control
coefficients
of
different
enzymes
For
optimal
growth
how
much
oxygen
and
carbon
source
are
taken
up
Such
models
have
been
constructed
for
several
organisms
including
prokaryotes
and
eukaryotes
Predictions
have
generally
achieved
good
agreement
with
experiments

Understanding
the

and
some
of
the
building
blocks
of
regulatory

Knowing
the
essential

of
proteinprotein

Recognizing
the

are
reprogrammable
under
changes

physiological

Integrating
the
logical
and
physical
interactions
in
the
real
but
relatively
simple
case
of
phage
For
a
cell
to
be
in
a
healthy
state
it
must
control
which
of
its
genes
are
being
expressed
and
at
what
levels
The
effect
of
this
control
is
to
achieve
the
proper
inventory
of
proteins
and
RNA
molecules
appropriate
to
the
developmental
and
physiological
state
of
the
cell
In
our
bodies
largely
irreversible
differentiation
events
create
different
tissues
These
play
different
metabolic
roles
Differentiation
gives
cells
tissuespecific
structures
and
also
tissuespecific
gene
expression
patterns
Moreover
when
environmental
conditions
change
most
cells
can
change
physiological
state
in
response
The
diauxic
shift
in
yeast
in
switching
between
aerobic
and
anaerobic
environments
is
381one
example
The
change
requires
an
altered
pattern
of
gene
expression
This
takes
a
little
time
accounting
for
the
lag
phase
observed
by
Monod
in
his
original
observations
of
diauxy
Two
relatively
simple
systems
that
have
been
examined
in
very
great
detail
are
the
Lac
operon
in
E
coli
and
the
lyticlysogenic
switch
in
phage
In
those
two
cases
we
know
not
only
the
abstract
logic
of
the
system
but
the
details
of
how
this
logic
is
implemented
at
the
level
of
atomicresolution
molecular
structures
Nucleotide
sequences
of
genomes
give
a
static
picture
of
an
organisms
potential
The
results
of
gene
expression
are
the
proteins
and
RNA
molecules
that
underlie
cellular
activity
Study
of
patterns
of
proteins
in
a
cell
as
a
function
of
state
and
conditions
is
a
mature
enterprise
and
has
produced
copious
amounts
of
useful
data
These
data
are
interesting
in
themselves
as
revealing
the
state
of
cellular
activity
and
also
for
what
they
can
tell
us
albeit
indirectly
about
how
gene
expression
is
being
controlled
Of
course
the
field
is
moving
towards
the
goal
of
direct
observations
of
mechanisms
of
expression
control
Proteomics
is
the
study
of
the
distribution
and
interactions
of
proteins
in
time
and
space
in
a
cell
or
organism
Highthroughput
experimental
methods
of
data
analysis
including
microarray
analysis
and
mass
spectrometry
are
giving
us
a
largescale
picture
of
the
protein
economy
in
living
things
Some
of
the
interactions
are
active
in
control
of
transcription
and
translation
These
include
binding
of
transcription
regulatory
proteins
to
DNA
and
interaction
of
specific
RNAs
with
mRNA
inhibiting
translation
The
goal
of
systems
biology
is
the
synthesis
of
genomic
transcriptomic
proteomic
and
other
data
into
an
integrated
picture
of
the
structure
dynamics
logistics
and
ultimately
the
logic
of
living
things
A
systems
biologist
will
combine
study
of
proteins
and
RNAs
the
genes
that
encode
them
the
molecules
that
control
their
expression
or
activity
once
expressed
and
the
set
of
other
proteins
and
nucleic
acids
with
which
they
interact
A
systems
biologist
will
assemble
into
a
metabolic
network
the
chemical
reactions
catalysed
by
the
enzymes
of
a
cell
see
Chapter
8
and
assemble
into
control
networks
the
mechanisms
that
regulate
their
activities
and
expression
Measurement
of
distributions
of
proteins
in
cells
is
a
mature
technology
but
one
that
is
also
in
flux
Competing
with
the
classical
microarray
technique
is
RNAseq
the
highthroughput
sequencing
of
RNAs
in
a
sample
DNA
microarrays
DNA
microarrays
analyse
the
mRNAs
in
a
cell
to
reveal
the
expression
patterns
of
proteins
or
genomic
DNAs
to
reveal
absent
or
mutated
genes
1
For
an
integrated
characterization
of
cellular
activity
we
want
to
determine
what
proteins
are
present
where
and
in
what
amounts
To
determine
the
expression
pattern
of
a
cells
genes
we
measure
the
relative
amounts
of
many
different
mRNAs
Hybridization
is
an
accurate
and
sensitive
way
to
detect
whether
any
particular
nucleic
acid
sequence
is
present
The
key
to
high
throughput
analysis
is
to
run
many
hybridization
experiments
in
parallel
2
Measuring
expression
patterns
can
help
to
identify
genes
associated
with
propensities
to
diseases
Some
diseases
such
as
cystic
fibrosis
arise
from
mutations
in
single
genes
For
these
isolating
a
region
by
classical
genetic
mapping
can
lead
to
pinpointing
the
lesion
Other
diseases
such
as
asthma
depend
on
interactions
among
many
genes
with
environmental
factors
as
complications
To
understand
the
aetiology
of
multifactorial
diseases
requires
the
ability
to
determine
and
analyse
expression
patterns
of
multiple
genes
which
may
be
distributed
around
382different
chromosomes
DNA
microarrays
or
DNA
chips
are
devices
for
checking
a
sample
simultaneously
for
the
presence
of
many
sequences
The
basic
idea
is
this
to
detect
whether
one
oligonucleotide
has
a
particular
known
sequence
test
whether
it
can
bind
to
an
oligo
with
the
complementary
sequence
a
onetoone
test
To
detect
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
query
oligo
in
a
mixture
spread
the
mixture
out
and
test
each
component
of
the
mixture
for
binding
to
the
oligo
complementary
to
the
query
a
manytoone
test
This
is
a
northern
or
Southern
blot
To
detect
the
presence
or
absence
of
many
oligonucleotides
in
a
mixture
synthesize
a
set
of
oligos
one
complementary
to
each
sequence
of
the
query
list
and
test
each
component
of
the
mixture
for
binding
to
each
member
of
the
set
of
complementary
oligos
a
many
tomany
test
Microarrays
provide
an
efficient
highthroughput
way
of
carrying
out
these
tests
in
parallel
To
achieve
parallel
hybridization
analysis
a
large
number
of
DNA
oligomers
are
affixed
to
known
locations
on
a
rigid
support
in
a
regular
twodimensional
array
The
mixture
to
be
analysed
is
prepared
with
fluorescent
tags
to
permit
detection
of
the
hybrids
After
exposing
the
array
to
the
mixture
each
element
of
the
array
to
which
some
component
of
the
mixture
has
become
attached
bears
the
tag
Because
we
know
the
sequence
of
the
oligomeric
probe
in
each
spot
in
the
array
measurement
of
the
positions
of
the
probes
identifies
their
sequences
This
analyses
the
components
present
in
the
sample
DNA
microarrays
are
distributed
on
a
small
wafer
of
glass
or
nylon
typically
2
cm
square
Oligonucleotides
are
attached
in
an
array
at
densities
between
10
000
and
250
000
positions
per
square
centimetre
The
spot
size
may
be
as
small
as
150
m
in
diameter
The
grid
is
typically
a
few
centimetres
across
A
yeast
chip
contains
over
6000
oligonucleotides
covering
all
known
genes
of
S
cerevisiae
A
DNA
array
or
DNA
chip
may
contain
400
000
probe
oligomers
Note
that
this
is
larger
than
the
total
number
of
genes
even
in
higher
organisms
excluding
immunoglobulin
genes
To
analyse
a
mixture
expose
it
to
the
microarray
under
conditions
that
promote
hybridization
then
wash
away
any
loose
probe
To
compare

Different
types
of

for
different
investigations
differ
in
the

of

The

In
an

The
target
sample
might
be
a

of
mRNAs
from

In
genomic
hybridization
one
looks
for
gains
or
losses
of
genes
or
changes
in
copy

The
target
sequences
fixed
on
the

are
large
pieces
of
genomic

from
known
chromosomal
locations
typically
5005000

The

mixtures
contain
genomic
DNA
from

For
instance
some
types
of
cancer
arise
from
chromosome
deletions
which
can
be
identified
by
microarrays

In

microarray
analysis
one
looks
for

Microarray
data
are
quantitative
but
imprecise
Microarrays
are
capable
of
comparing

of

allows
investigation
of

Microarray

Microarrays
provide
another
highthroughput
stream
of
data
production
in
bioinformatics
A
standard
called
MIAME
which
stands

About

describes
the

of
the

precision
is
low
Moreover
mRNA
levels
detected
by
the
array
do
not
always
quantitatively
reflect
protein
levels
Indeed
usually
mRNAs
are
reverse
transcribed
into
more
stable
cDNAs
for
microarray
analysis
the
yields
in
this
step
may
also
be
nonuniform
Microarray

are
therefore
semiquantitative
in
that
distinction
between

and

is
possible
determination
of
relative

of

in
a
controlled

is
more
difficult
and
measurement
of
absolute

is
beyond
the

of

Analysis
of
microarray
data
The
raw
data
of
a
microarray
experiment
are
displayed
as
an
image
in
which
the
colour
and
intensity
of
the
fluorescence
reflect
the
extent
of
hybridization
to
alternative
probes
The
two
sets
of
probes
are
tagged
with
red
and
green
fluorophores
If
only
one
probe
hybridizes
the
spot
appears
red
if
only
the
other
probe
hybridizes
the
spot
appears
green
If
both
hybridize
the
colour
of
the
corresponding
spot
appears
red
green
yellow

Plate
XI
The
initial
goal
of
data
processing
is
a
gene
expression
table
This
is
a
matrix
in
which
the
rows
correspond
to
different
genes
and
the
columns
to
different
samples
Different
spots
in
a
microarray
pattern
such
as
that
shown
in
Plate
XI
correspond
to
different
genes
For
each
gene
results
from
different
sets
of
samples
appear
in
the
red
or
green
channel
or
neither
or
both
There
is
extensive
redundancy
in
the
oligos
in
a
microarray
each
gene
may
be
represented
by
several
spots
corresponding
to
different
regions
of
the
gene
sequence
inclusion
of
controls
with
a
deliberate
mismatch
allows
data
verification
Typically
one
gene
may
correspond
to
3040
spots
The
samples
may
vary
according
to
experimental
conditions
andor
physiological
states
or
they
may
be
extracted
from
different
individuals
or
different
tissues
or
developmental
stages
The
process
of
data
reduction
to
produce
the
gene
expression
matrix
involves
many
technical
details
of
image
processing
checking
internal
controls
dealing
with
missing
data
selecting
reliable
measurements
and
putting
the
results
of
different
arrays
on
consistent
scales
The
derived
gene
expression
table
indicates
relative
expression
levels
A
change
in
expression
levels
of
a
gene
between
two
samples
by
a
factor
of
152
or
more
is
generally
considered
significant
Extraction
of
reliable
biological
information
from
a
gene
expression
table
is
not
straightforward
Despite
extensive
internal
controls
there
is
considerable
noise
in
the
experimental
technique
In
many
cases
variability
is
inherent
within
the
samples
themselves
Microorganisms
can
be
cloned
animals
can
be
inbred
to
a
comparable
degree
of
homogeneity
However
experiments
using
RNA
from
human
sourcesfor
example
a
set
of
patients
suffering
from
a
disease
and
a
corresponding
set
of
healthy
controlsare
at
the
mercy
of
the
large
individual
variations
that
humans
present
Indeed
384inbred
animals
and
even
apparently
identical
eukaryotic
tissueculture
samples
show
extensive
variability
Another
intrinsic
disadvantageand
a
severe
onein
interpreting
gene
expression
data
is
the
fact
that
the
number
of
genes
is
much
larger
than
the
number
of
samples
Computationally
we
are
trying
to
understand
the
relationship
of
a
space
of
very
many
variables
the
genes
to
a
space
of
observations
the
phenotype
from
only
a
few
measured
points
the
samples
The
sparsity
of
the
observations
does
not
give
us
anywhere
near
adequate
coverage
Statistical
methods
bear
a
heavy
burden
in
the
analysis
to
give
us
confidence
in
the
significance
of
our
conclusions
Two
general
approaches
to
the
analysis
of
a
gene
expression
matrix
involve
1
comparisons
focused
on
the
genesthat
is
comparing
distributions
of
expression
patterns
of
different
genes
by
comparing
rows
in
the
expression
matrixand
2
comparisons
focused
on
samples
that
is
comparing
expression
profiles
of
different
samples
by
comparing
columns
of
the
expression
matrix
1
Comparisons
focused
on
genes
How
do
gene
expression
patterns
vary
among
the
different
samples
Suppose
a
gene
is
known
to
be
involved
in
a
disease
or
to
a
change
in
physiological
state
in
response
to
changed
conditions
Other
genes
coexpressed
with
the
known
gene
may
participate
in
related
processes
contributing
to
the
disease
or
the
change
in
state
More
generally
if
two
rows
two
genes
of
the
gene
expression
matrix
show
similar
expression
patterns
across
the
samples
this
suggests
a
common
pattern
of
regulation
and
possibly
some
relationship
between
their
functions
including
but
not
limited
to
a
possible
physical
interaction
2
Comparisons
focused
on
samples
How
do
samples
differ
in
their
gene
expression
patterns
A
consistent
set
of
differences
among
the
samples
may
characterize
the
classes
which
the
samples
represent
If
the
samples
are
from
different
controlled
groups
for
instance
diseased
and
healthy
animals
do
samples
from
different
groups
show
consistently
different
expression
patterns
If
so
given
a
novel
sample
we
can
assign
it
to
its
proper
class
on
the
basis
of
its
observed
gene
expression
pattern
How
then
do
we
measure
the
similarity
of
different
rows
or
columns
Each
row
or
column
of
the
expression
matrix
can
be
considered
as
a
vector
in
a
space
of
many
dimensions
The
rowvectors
a
row
corresponds
to
a
gene
each
entry
of
which
refers
to
the
same
gene
in
different
samples
has
as
many
elements
as
there
are
samples
The
columnvectors
a
column
corresponds
to
a
sample
each
entry
of
which
refers
to
a
different
gene
in
a
single
sample
has
as
many
elements
as
there
are
genes
reported
It
is
possible
to
calculate
the
angle
between
different
rowvectors
or
between
different
columnvectors
to
provide
a
measure
of
their
similarities
It
is
then
natural
to
ask
whether
subsets
of
the
points
form
natural
clusterspoints
with
high
mutual
similaritycharacterizing
either
sets
of
genes
or
sets
of
samples
Depending
on
the
origin
of
the
samples
what
is
already
known
about
them
and
what
we
want
to
learn
data
analysis
can
proceed
in
different
ways
1
The
simplest
case
is
a
carefully
controlled
study
using
two
different
sets
of
samples
of
known
characteristics
For
instance
the
samples
might
be
taken
from
bacteria
grown
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
drug
from
juvenile
or
adult
fruit
flies
or
from
healthy
humans
and
patients
with
a
disease
We
can
focus
on
the
question
what
differences
in
gene
expression
pattern
characterize
the
two
states
Can
we
design
a
classification
rule
such
that
given
another
sample
we
can
assign
it
to
its
proper
class
This
would
be
applicable
in
diagnosis
of
disease
For
instance
determination
of
the
subtype
of
a
leukaemia
permits
more
accurate
treatment
and
prognosis
Subject
to
the
availability
of
adequate
data
such
an
approach
can
be
extended
to
systems
of
more
385than
two
classes
Computationally
training
such
a
classification
algorithm
is
called
supervised
learning
The
expression
pattern
of
each
sample
is
given
by
a
vector
corresponding
to
a
single
column
of
the
matrix
This
corresponds
to
a
point
in
a
manydimensional
space
as
many
dimensions
as
there
are
genes
In
favourable
cases
the
points
may
fall
in
separated
regions
of
space
Then
a
scientist
or
a
computer
program
will
be
able
to
draw
a
boundary
between
them
In
other
cases
separation
of
classes
may
be
more
difficult
Consider
the
distribution
of
football
players
during
a
match
At
the
start
of
play
a
line
drawn
across
the
midfield
separates
the
teams
that
is
the
midfield
line
divides
the
field
into
two
regions
each
region
containing
exclusively
the
players
of
one
of
the
teams
During
play
the
teams
become
commingled
and
it
is
impossible
to
draw
a
single
line
that
divides
the
field
into
regions
that
separate
the
teams
2
In
a
different
experimental
situation
we
might
not
be
able
to
preassign
different
samples
to
different
categories
Instead
we
hope
to
extract
the
classification
of
samples
from
the
analysis
The
goal
is
to
cluster
the
data
to
identify
classes
of
samples
and
the
differences
between
the
genes
that
characterize
them
Many
clustering
algorithms
have
been
applied
to
microarray
data
including
those
that
try
to
work
out
simultaneously
both
the
number
of
clusters
and
the
boundaries
between
them
All
algorithms
must
face
the
difficulty
arising
from
the
sparsity
of
sampling
of
the
very
high
dimensional
space
of
the
measurement
Sometimes
it
is
possible
to
simplify
the
problem
by
identifying
a
small
number
of
combinations
of
genes
that
account
for
a
large
portion
of
the
variability
This
is
called
reduction
of
dimensionality

Reduction
of
dimensionality
The
distribution
of
gene
expression
data
in
a
space
of
a
large
number
of
dimensions
means
that
1
coverage
of
the
space
with
a
limited
number
of
samples
is
sparse
and
2
it
is
difficult
to
visualize
the
distribution
of
sample
points
In
some
cases
the
distribution
may
depend
primarily
on
fewer
equivalent
variables
and
it
is
very
advantageous
to
find
them
and
transform
the
data
accordingly
A
simple
example
illustrates
the
basic
idea
Consider
a
distribution
of
groups
of
people
picnicking
on
a
beach
Represent
the
position
of
each
person
by
the
x
y
and
z
coordinates
of
the
tip
of
his
or
her
nose
Make
the
x
axis
parallel
to
the
shoreline
the
y
axis
perpendicular
to
the
shoreline
and
the
z
axis
vertical
Obviously
height
is
irrelevant
this
is
really
a
twodimensional
not
a
threedimensional
distribution
To
cluster
the
people
into
groups
perhaps
families
or
surfing
clubs
the
x
and
y
coordinates
carry
all
the
significant
data
and
the
z
coordinate
carries
only
irrelevant
information
such
as
the
heights
of
the
people
and
whether
or
not
they
are
standing
up
or
sitting
on
the
sand
In
this
case
to
reduce
the
dimensionality
from
3
to
2
we
need
only
ignore
the
z
coordinate
Indeed
if
the
tide
comes
in
and
the
beach
area
becomes
narrower
the
dimension
along
the
shoreline
carries
the
bulk
of
the
information
and
the
dimensionality
could
be
further
reduced
from
2
to
1
Alternatively
suppose
that
groups
of
people
are
climbing
a
vertical
rock
face
rising
parallel
to
the
shoreline
This
also
is
really
a
twodimensional
not
a
threedimensional
distribution
but
in
this
case
it
is
the
x
and
z
coordinates
that
carry
the
information
In
more
complex
cases
reduction
in
dimension
requires
more
than
simply
picking
coordinates
to
ignore
Suppose
the
people
are
distributed
on
a
ski
slope
To
reduce
the
distribution
from
three
to
two
dimensions
we
could
not
simply
ignore
a
coordinate
but
would
have
to
project
the
data
onto
the
oblique
plane
parallel
to
the
slope
This
idea
of
projection
of
the
data
onto
a
lowerdimensional
space
that
contains
the
important
components
of
the
variation
is
the
key
to
the
methods
Practical
problems
of
data
analysis
are
harder
than
these
simple
illustrations
For
one
thing
the
starting
dimensions
are
much
higher
than
three
and
the
reduction
in
dimensionality
is
potentially
much
greater
For
another
it
is
not
obvious
how
to
achieve
the
dimensionality
reduction
because
we
dont
have
the
easily
386visualizable
picture
of
the
physical
space
and
the
distribution
of
people
on
a
beach
rock
face
or
ski
slope
Nevertheless
the
questions
to
be
answered
remain
along
what
directions
should
we
project
the
data
to
retain
the
largest
discrimination
using
the
fewest
dimensions
Mathematical
methods
known
as
principalcomponent
analysis
PCA
using
the
singular
value
decomposition
SVD
can
solve
this
problem
These
methods
automatically
select
a
new
coordinate
system
that
best
represents
the
variability
of
the
data
along
the
fewest
axes
and
for
each
new
coordinate
axis
the
calculation
gives
a
measure
of
the
contribution
of
that
coordinate
to
accounting
for
the
overall
variability
of
the
data
Although
two
dimensions
may
well
not
contain
all
important
components
of
the
variation
we
can
always
pick
the
best
twodimensional
projection
and
plot
the
result
on
a
graph
this
has
the
immense
advantage
of
allowing
scientists
to
stare
at
the
data
and
think
about
them
Threedimensional
distributions
can
also
be
represented
visually
with
somewhat
greater
difficulty

Interpretation
of
microarray

regulation
of
genes
by
BRCA1
and
implications
for
the
role
of
BRCA1
dysfunction
or
silencing
in
tumour
development
The
BRCA1
gene
encodes
a
tumour
suppressor
It
is
mutated
in
approximately
90
of
patients
with
familial
predisposition
to
breast
and
ovarian
cancer
A
single
defective
BRCA1
allele
is
sufficient
to
increase
risk
for
in
any
cell
the
normal
copy
of
the
gene
may
be
lost
or
in
a
small
fraction
of
cases
rendered
inactive
by
promotor
methylation
BRCA1
is
an
1863residue
protein
It
has
an
Nterminal
ring
finger
domain
followed
by
a
predicted
helical
coiledcoil
region
followed
by
two
tandem
BRCT
domains
that
bind
other
proteins
and
also
regulate
transcription
BRCT
abbreviates
BRCA
Cterminal

BRCA1
interacts
with
many
other
proteins
to
form
functional
complexes
and
is
thereby
involved
in
several
different
activities
including
sensing
and
signalling
of
lesions
in
DNA
BRCA1
responds
to
several
types
of
DNA
damagefor

at

in

cycle
in
part
at
least
by

of

A
unifying
idea
about
BRCA1
is
that
the
protein
encoded
mediates
responses
to
DNA
damage
by
eliciting
repair
mechanisms
and
in
case
repair
is
unsuccessful

that

of

to
the

in

enhancing
the
chances

The

genes
differentially

in

Standing

for

changed

or

were
checked
for

in

Clustering

matrix
shows
the
clear
distinction
between
up
and
downregulated
genes
and
gives
an
impression
of
the
variability
among
replicates
See
Plate
XII
Many
of
the
proteins
encoded
by
upregulated
genes
are
hormone
receptors
and
structural
proteins
Many
of
the
proteins
encoded
by
downregulated
genes
are
involved
in
DNA
replication
and
translation
Notable
among
the
genes
identified
in
the
study
are
the
following
1
Consistent
with
the
tissuespecific
appearance
of
tumours
as
a
result
of
BRCA1
dysfunction
some
of
the
genes
with
altered
expression
patterns
are
involved
in
oestrogenmediated
control
pathways
suggesting
a
possible
link
to
the
tissuespecificity
enigma
The
set
of
proteins
implicated
includes
cyclin
D1
and
Myc
which
are
upregulated
by
lower
levels
of
BRCA1
For
comparison
with
the
clinical
setting
low
levels
of
BRCA1
expression
correspond
to
patients
with
reduced
or
absent
BRCA1
function
that
is
the
highrisk
group
and
high
levels
are
analogous
to
normal
controls
However
the
experiments
of
Welcsh
et
al
did
not
try
to
reproduce
actual
endogenous
BRCA1
expression
levels
observed
in
patients
and
normal
counterparts
Cyclin
D1
and
Myc
are
observed
to
be
overexpressed
in
20
of
breast
cancers
consistent
with
their
repression
by
functional
BRCA1
2
Conversely
JAK
and
STAT
proteins
are
downregulated
by
decreased
levels
of
BRCA1
These
proteins
are
implicated
as
growth
inhibitors
in
control
pathways
that
govern
proliferation
differentiation
apoptosis
and
transformation
Loss
of
BRCA1
activity
would
be
expected
to
reduce
JAK1
and
STAT1
levels
promoting
388cellular
proliferation
and
reducing
apoptosis
This
is
consistent
with
the
observation
that
Stat1
null
mice
develop
tumours
more
readily
than
normals
The
relationships
detected
by
Welcsh
et
al
are
part
of
the
cells
control
network
However
some
of
the
products
of
genes
regulated
by
BRCA1
are
also
known
to
be
involved
in
formation
of
functional
complexes
with
BRCA1
For
instance
Myc
the
product
of
a
potent
oncogenebinds
to
BRCA1
suggesting
a
direct
inhibition
of
Myc
by
BRCA1
Thus
reduced
BRCA1
levels
would
have
the
dual
effect
of
reducing
the
inhibition
of
Myc
through
binding
and
increasing
the
expression
of
Myc
through
loss
of
transcriptional
repression
Thus
Myc
is
linked
to
BRCA1
through
both
physical
and
regulatory
interactions
We
have
seen
in
an
earlier
chapter
that
the
idea
of
two
parallel
interaction
networks
in
cellsphysical
interactions
and
regulatory
interactionsis
a
useful
distinction
However
it
is
one
that
is
difficult
to
maintain
in
a
system
such
as
BRCA1
function
in
which
the
two
are
so
closely
intertwined
Mass

Mass

physical

that

Mass

this

of

to

to

It
is
a
highthroughput
method
capable
of
processing
100

though
sample

time
is
longer
However
there
are
limitations
Only
proteins
of
known
sequence
can
be
identified
from
peptide
mass
fingerprints
because
only
their
predicted
fragment
masses
are
included
in
the
databases
As
with
other
fingerprinting
methods
it
would
be
possible
to
show
that
two
proteins
from
different
samples
are
likely
to
be
the
same
even
if
no
identification
is
possible
Also
posttranslational
modifications
interfere
with
the
method
because
they
alter
the
masses
of
the
fragments
The
results
shown
in
Figure

are
from
an
experiment
in
which
the
molecular
masses
of
the

were
determined
from
their

of

over
a
known

as
illustrated
in

these

Proteins
being
fairly
delicate
objects
it
has
been
challenging
to
vaporize
and
ionize

without

Two
softionization
methods
that
solve
this
problem
are
described
here
1
The
matrixassisted
laser
desorption
ionization
MALDI
in
which
the
sample
is
introduced
into
the
spectrometer
in
dry
form
mixed
with
a
substrate
or
matrix
that
moderates
the
delivery
of
energy
A
laser
pulse
absorbed
initially
by
the
matrix
vaporizes
and
ionizes
the
protein
The
MALDITOF
combination
that
produced
the
results
shown
in
Figure
93
is
a
common
experimental
configuration
2
The
electrospray
ionization
ESI
method
starts
with
the
sample
in
liquid
form
Spraying
it
through
a
small
capillary
with
an
electric
field
at
the
tip
creates
an
aerosol
of
highly
charged
droplets
As
the
solvent
evaporates
the
droplets
contract
bringing
the
charges
closer
together
and
increasing
the
repulsive
forces
between
them
Eventually
the
droplets
explode
into
smaller
droplets
each
with
less
total
charge
This
process
repeats
creating
ions
which
may
be
multiply
charged
devoid
of
solvent
These
ions
are
transferred
into
the
high
vacuum
region
of
the
mass
spectrometer
Because
the
sample
is
initially
in
liquid
form
ESI
lends
itself
to
automation
in
which
a
mixture
of
tryptic
peptides
passes
through
a
highperformance
liquid
chromatograph
HPLC

in

394Tuberculosis
is
an
infectious
disease
caused
by
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
Despite

of
vaccines
and
drugs
it
remains
a
potent
killer
Tuberculosis
is
the
most
common
cause
of
death
from
infectious
disease
claiming
about

per

Of
the
9

Organization

occur
in
developing
countries
in
Asia
and
subSaharan
Africa
HIV
infection
also
more
prevalent
in
developing
countries
exacerbates
the
mortality
of
tuberculosis
infection
by
lowering
resistance
Our
bodies
frontline
defences
against
most
bacterial
infections
include
macrophages
which
are
cells
of
the
immune
system
that
engulf
bacteria
and
attack
them
with
a
variety
of
chemical
and
biochemical
agents
M
tuberculosis
exceptionally
is
adapted
to
survive
within
the
macrophage
Part
of
its
adaptation
is
structural
cells
of
M
tuberculosis
and
close
relatives
surround
themselves
with
a
waxy
coat
The
low
permeability
of
the
coat
shields
them
from
the
inhospitable
environment
within
the
macrophage
including
low
pH
and
oxidative
stress
The
bacteria
also
make
substantial
changes
to
gene
expression
patterns
to
adapt
their
physiological
state
to
these
surroundings
After
several
decades
of
decline
following
the
development
of
effective
drugs
the
incidence
of
tuberculosis
began
to
increase
in
the
mid1980s
One
reason
is
emergence
of
resistant
strains
A
primary
drug
used
in
prevention
and
therapy
of
tuberculosis
is
isoniazid
isonicotinic
acid
hydrazide
Isoniazid
attacks
M
tuberculosis
by
interfering
with
synthesis
of
its
cell
wall
without
which
the
bacterium
cannot
survive
Targets
of
isoniazid
include
an
NADHdependent
enoylacyl
carrier
protein
ACP
reductase
InhA
and
a
ketoacyl
ACP
synthase
KasA
These
enzymes
participate
in
synthesis
of
mycolic
acids
major
components
of
the
cell
wall
Isoniazid
must
be
converted
to
an
active
form
after
absorption
by
the
bacterial
cell
The
enzyme
that
effects
the
conversion
KatG
is
a
natural
suspect
for
involvement
in
resistance
Its
natural
function
is
to
detoxify
peroxides
Several
methods
have
been
applied
to
elucidate
the
adaptations
responsible
for
isoniazid
resistance

The
logic
of
the

is
that
the

are

of
the

and
feedback
mechanisms
are
acting
to

for

These
include
mutations
in
KatG
that
impede
activation
of
isoniazid
and
mutations
in
InhA
to
escape
inhibition
by
the
activated
form
Note
that
because
oxidative
stress
is
part
of
the
hosts
natural
defence
to
infection
simple
knockout
of
KatG
could
be
a
dangerous
strategy
for
the
bacterium
Ideally
the
bacterium
would
reduce
the
activity
of
the
enzyme
in
isoniazid
activation
but
retain
activity
against
small
peroxides
In
this
way
it
would
reduce
susceptibility
to
the
drug
while
maintaining
its
general
fitness
in
the
environment
within
the
macrophage
Precisely
this
balance
is
achieved
by

Properties
of
proteinprotein
complexes
Enzyme
catalysis
involves
proteinligand
complexes
We
discussed
some
fundamental
ideas
in
Chapter
8
From
the
point
of
view
of
the
thermodynamics
proteinprotein
binding
is
just
another
example
of
proteinligand
association
However
the
biological
significance
of
the
complexes
tends
to
be
quite
dissimilar
Also
the
structure
and
energetics
of
proteinprotein
complexes
exhibits
numerous
features
unlike
those
of
proteins
binding
small
metabolites
We
shall
therefore
now
focus
on
the
special
properties
of
proteinprotein
association
Stoichiometry
what
is
the
composition
of
the
complex
Stable
oligomeric
proteins
may
contain
many
copies
of
one
protein
or
combine
different
ones
Among
aggregates
of
a
single
protein
complexes
containing
odd
numbers
of
molecules
are
less
common
than
those
containing
even
numbers
Oligomers
complexes
containing
a
few
copies
of
the
same
protein
dimers
trimers
usually
show
symmetry
For
instance
insulin
forms
a
hexamer
with
threefold
and
twofold
axes
Some
prokaryotic
proteins
containing
identical
subunits
are
homologous
to
eukaryotic
proteins
containing
related
but
nonidentical
subunits
arising
by
gene
duplication
and
divergence
The
proteasome
is
an
example
Some
viruses
achieve
diversity
without
duplication
by
combining
proteins
with
the
same
sequence
but
different
conformations
Protein
complexes
vary
widely
in
the
numbers
and
variety
of
molecules
they
contain
Some
complexes
contain
only
a
few
proteins
but
others
are
very
large
for
example
pyruvate
dehydrogenase
contains
hundreds
of
subunits
and
some
viral
capsids
contain
thousands
Many
very
large
aggregrates
have
clinical
importance
including
bovine
spongiform
encephalopathy
BSE
or
socalled
mad
cow
disease
Alzheimers
and
Huntingtons
disease
see
Table
92
Amyloidoses
are
diseases
characterized
by
extracellular
fibrillar
deposits
usually
with
a
common
crossedsheet
structure
They
arise
from
a
variety
of
causes
including
destabilizing
mutations
overproduction
of
a
protein
and
inadequate
clearance
in
renal
failure
Misfolded
proteins
are
more
prone
to
aggregate
and
mutated
proteins
are
more
prone
to
misfold
Large
local
concentrations
such
as
can
occur
in
myelomas
that
overproduce
immunoglobulin
light
chains
also
aggravate
the
threat
of
aggregation
Affinity
how
stable
is
the
complex
A
common
index
of
the
affinity
of
a
complex
is
the
dissociation
constant
K
D
the
equilibrium
constant
for
the
reverse
of
the
binding
reaction

denote
the
numerical

of
the

of

The
lower

K

tighter

D
corresponds
to
the
concentration
of

at
which
half
the
proteins

Recall
that
the
Michaelis
constant
of
an
enzyme

is
related
to
the
Gibbs

of
dissociation

Dissociation

of
proteinligand

span
a
very
wide
range

Structural
studies
have
elucidated
several
important
features
of
the
interactions
between

contributing
to

What
holds
the
proteins
together
Burial
of
hydrophobic

hydrogen
bonds
and
salt

Do
proteins
change
conformation
upon
formation
of
complexes
In
some
cases
they
do
In
these
cases
the
interaction
energy
has
to
pay
for
the
conformational
change
and
the
interface
tends
to
be
larger
The

What
determines

Prediction
of
protein

the

of

the

of
this
problem
together
with

and
the

Lifetimes
are
important
if
you
want
to
purify
a
complex
it
is
important
that
its
average
lifetime
is
longer
than
the
duration
of
the
isolation
procedure
Conversely
if
a
proteinprotein
complex
is
to
mediate
transmission
of
a

a
short
lifetime
provides
a
natural
reset
mechanism
to

How
are
complexes
organized
in
three
dimensions
When
two
proteins
form
a
complex
each
leaves
a
footprint
on
the
surface
of
the
other
defining
the
portion
of
the
surface
involved
in
the
interaction
If
two
proteins
interact
using
the
same
surface
on
both
the
complex
is
closed
If
two
proteins
interact
through
different
surfaces
the
complex
is
open
The
significance
is
that
a
closed
complex
does
not
allow
additional
proteins
to
bind
with
the
same
interaction
An
open
complex
in
which
the
surface
of
potential
interaction
is
not
occluded
can
grow
by
accretion
of
additional
subunits
Thus
open
but
not
closed
complexes
are
compatible
with
formation
of
repetitive
aggregates
Do
proteins
change
conformation
upon
complex
formation
Some
protein
complexes
form
by
the
coming
together
of
rigid
subunits
The
subunits
in
these
complexes
have
the
same
structure
in
the
complex
that
they
have
separately
Other
protein
complexes
involve
structural
changes
upon
complex
formation
These
include
complexes
of
subunits
that
are
not
stable
separately

Features
of
proteinprotein
interfaces
Burial
of
protein
surface
the
surface
buried
by
formation
of
a
complex
is
the
difference
between
the
accessible
surface
area
ASA
of
the
complex
and
the
sum
of
the
ASAs
of
the
components
separately
A
typical
proteinprotein
interface
might
involve
22
residues
90
atoms
of
which
20
would
be
mainchain
atoms
with
the
occasional
water
molecule
A
histogram
of
surface
area
buried
in
binary
protein
complexes
shows
a
peak
centred
at
1600
2
The
minimum
buried
surface
for
stability
of
a
proteinprotein
complex
is
about
1000
2
Complexes
that
bury
2000
2
tend
to
involve
conformational
changes
upon
complex
formation
Each
square
angstrom
of
hydrophobic
surface
buried
contributes
about
105
J
to
the
free
energy
of
stabilization
The
composition
of
the
interface
The
chemical
character
of
proteinprotein
interfaces
is
intermediate
between
that
of
the
surfaces
and
interiors
of
monomeric
globular
proteins
Interfaces
are
enriched
in
neutral
polar
atoms
at
the
expense
of
charged
atoms
The
amino
acid
composition
of
interfaces
are
enriched
in
aromatic
residues
His
Phe
Tyr
Trprelative
to
remaining
exposed
surface
There
is
a
lesser
degree
of
enrichment
in
aliphatic
sidechainsLeu
Ile
Val
Metand
Arg
but
surprisingly
not
Lys
Complementarity
of
interfaces
is
responsible
for
specificity
Complementarity
involves
both
good
packing
at
the
occluding
surfaces
and
proper
juxtaposition
of
hydrogenbonded
and
charged
atoms
Typically
there
is
one
hydrogen
bond
per
170
2
of
interface
area
Isolated
water
molecules
occupy
sites
in
many
interfaces
Typically
there
is
one
fixed
water
molecule
per
100
2
of
interface
Protein
interaction
networks
The
units
from
which
interaction
networks
are
assembled
are
for
physical
networks
a
proteinprotein
or
proteinnucleic
acid
complex
for
logical
networks
a
dynamic
connection
in
which
the
activity
of
a
process
is
affected
by
a
400change
in
external
conditions
or
by
the
activity
of
another
process
Most
experiments
reveal
only
pairwise
interactions
The
challenges
are
to
integrate
pairwise
interactions
into
a
network
and
then
to
study
the
structure
and
dynamics
of
the
system
Many
techniques
detect
physical
interactions
directly
These
include
Xray
and
NMR
structure
determinations
can
not
only
identify
the
components
of
the
complex
but
reveal
how
they
interact
and
whether
conformational
changes
occur
upon
binding
twohybrid
screening
systems
transcriptional
activators
such
as
Gal4
contain
a
DNAbinding
domain
and
an
activation
domain
Suppose
these
two
domains
are
separated
and
one
test
protein
is
fused
to
the
DNAbinding
domain
and
a
second
test
protein
is
fused
to
the
activation
domain
Then
a
reporter
protein
will
be
expressed
only
if
the
components
of
the
activator
are
brought
together
by
formation
of
a
complex
between
two
test
proteins

Other
methods
provide
complementary
information
Domain
recombination
networks
Many
eukaryotic
proteins
contain
multiple
domains
A
feature
of
eukaryotic
evolution
is
that
a
domain
may
appear
in
different
proteins
with
different
partners
In
some
cases
proteins
in
a
bacterial
operon
catalysing
successive
steps
in
a
metabolic
pathway
are
fused
into
a
single
multidomain
protein
in
eukarya
The
domains
of
the
eukaryotic
protein
are
individually
homologous
to
the
separate
bacterial
proteins
Examples
of
proteins
fused
in
eukarya
and
separate
in
prokaryotes
are
also
known
It
is
possible
to
create
a
network
by
defining
an
interaction
between
two
protein
domains
whenever
homologues
of
the
two
domains
appear
in
the
same
protein
This
is
evidence
for
some
functional
link
between
the
domains
even
in
species
where
the
domains
appear
in
separate
proteins
Coexpression
patterns
Clustering
of
microarray
data
identifies
proteins
with
common
expression
patterns
They
may
have
the
same
tissue
distribution
or
be
up
or
downregulated
in
parallel
in
different
physiological
states
This
is
also
suggestive
evidence
that
they
share
some
functional
link
In
the
response
of
M
tuberculosis
to
isoniazid
Case
Study
92
genes
for
the
fatty
acid
synthesis
complex
are
coordinately
upregulated
They
are
on
an
operonlike
gene
cluster
and
in
fact
these
proteins
do
form
a
physical
complex
On
the
other
hand
alkyl
hydroperoxidase
AHPC
is
also
upregulated
in
response
to
isoniazid
AHPC
acts
to
relieve
oxidative
stress
There
is
no
evidence
that
it
physically
interacts
with
the
fatty
acid
synthesis
complex
or
that
it
mediates
a
metabolic
transformation
coupled
to
fatty
acid
synthesis
It
is
a
second
component
of
the
response
to
isoniazid
Phylogenetic
distribution
patterns
The
phylogenetic
profile
of
a
protein
is
the
set
of
organisms
in
which
it
and
its
homologues
appear
Proteins
in
a
common
structural
complex
or
pathway
are
functionally
linked
and
expected
to
coevolve
Therefore
proteins
that
share
a
phylogenetic
profile
are
likely
to
have
a
functional
link
or
at
least
to
have
a
common
subcellular
origin
There
need
be
no
sequence
or
structural
similarity
between
the
proteins
that
share
a
phylogenetic
distribution
pattern
A
welcome
feature
of
this
method
is
that
it
derives
information
about
the
function
of
a
protein
from
its
relationship
to
nonhomologous
proteins
There
are
many
ways
to
link
proteins
including

interactions

The
networks
formed
by
combining
each
set
of
interactions
are
different
although
they
overlap
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
They
give
different
views
of
the
kinds
of

between
proteins
that

It
is

to

of

Components
of
the
primosome
assembly
in
Bacillus
subtilis
The
first
step
in
DNA
replication
in
B
subtilis
is
the
binding
of
initiator
proteins
to
specific
DNA
sequences
that
serve
as
origins
of
replication
These
then
recruit
a
nucleoprotein
complex
called
the
primosome
A
major
component
of
the
primosome
is
DnaC
a
hexameric
replicative
helicase

It
is
believed
that
steps
in
the
process
include
1
binding
of
an
initiator
protein
DnaA
or
PriA
to
an
appropriate
singlestranded
DNA
sequence

DnaC

DnaB
and
DnaI
are
regulators
of
DnaC
activity

DnaC
is
loaded
onto
the
singlestranded
DNA
forming
a
hexameric
assembly

DnaG
is
recruited
to
prime
DNA

Scientists
at
the

created
a
database
of
the
protein
interaction
network
of
B
subtilis

are

The
elementary
step
in
a
regulatory
network
An
input
impulse
is
received
by
a
node
which
transmits
a
signal
to
a
downstream
node
causing
an
output
action
This
is
followed
by
reset
of
the
upstream
node
to
its
inactive
state
Combination
of
such
elementary
diagrams
gives
rise
to
the
complex
regulatory
networks
in
biology
Some
stimuli
arise
from
genetic
programs
Some
regulatory
events
are
responses
to
current
internal
metabolite
concentrations
Others
originate
outside
the
cell
a
signal
detected
by
surface
receptors
is
transmitted
across
the
membrane
to
an
intracellular
target
Control
may
be
exerted
in
the
field
by
several
mechanisms
such
as
inhibitors
dimerization
ligandinduced
conformational
changes
including
but
not
limited
to
allosteric
effects
GDPGTP
exchange
or
kinasephosphorylase
switches
and
differential
turnover
rates
at
headquarters
through
control
over
gene
expression
One
signal
can
trigger
many
responses
Each
response
may
be
stimulatory
increasing
an
activity
or
inhibitory
decreasing
an
activity
Transmission
of
signals
may
damp
out
stimuli
or
amplify
them
There
are
ample
opportunities
for
complexity
opportunities
of
which
cells
have
taken
extensive
advantage
Gproteincoupled
receptors
GPCRs
illustrate
the
components
of
signal
transduction
Recall
that
GPCRs
contain
seven
transmembrane
helices
with
a
binding
site
for
triggering
ligands
on
the
extracellular
side
and
a
binding
site
for
the
downstream
recipient
of
the
signal
a
heterotrimeric
G
protein
on
the
intracellular
side
G
proteins
consist
of
three
subunits
G
G
and
G
G
and
G
are
anchored
to
the
membrane
In
the
resting
inactive
state
G
binds
GDP
An
activated
GPCR
binds
to
a
specific
G
protein
and
catalyses
GDPGTP
exchange
in
the
G
subunit
This
destabilizes
the
trimer
dissociating
G
The
separated
components
G
and
G
G
activate
downstream
targets
such
as
adenylyl
cyclase
A
single
activated
GPCR
can
interact
successively
with
many
G
protein
molecules
amplifying
the
signal
It
is
therefore
essential
to
turn
the
signal
off
after
it
has
had
its
effect
Mutations
that
render
a
GPCR
constitutively
active
cause
a
number
of
diseases
the
symptoms
emerging
from
a
war
between
the
rogue
receptor
and
the
feedback
mechanisms
that
are
unequal
to
the
task
of
restraining
its
effects
Different
GPCRs
have
different
mechanisms
for
restoring
the
resting
state
Rhodopsin
for
example
is
inactivated
by
cleavage
of
the
isomerized
chromophore
The
activity
of
the
heterotrimeric
G
proteins
is
turned
off
by
the
GTPase
activity
of
G
converting
G
GTP
G
GDP
G
GDP
does
not
bind
to
its
receptors
shutting
down
that
pathway
of
signal
transmission
Instead
G
GDP
rebinds
the
G
G
subunits
This
resets
the
system
405Signal
transduction
and
transcriptional
control
The
signal
transduction
network
exerts
control
in
the
field
by
a
variety
of
mechanisms
including
inhibitors
dimerization
ligandinduced
conformational
changes
including
but
not
limited
to
allosteric
effects
GDPGTP
exchange
or
kinasephosphorylase
switches
and
differential
turnover
rates
This
component
acts
fast
on
subsecond
timescales
The
transcriptional
regulatory
network
exerts
control
at
headquarters
through
control
over
gene
expression
This
component
is
slower
acting
on
a
timescale
of
minutes
General
characteristics
of
all
control
pathways
a
single
signal
can
trigger
a
single
response
or
many
responses
a
single
response
can
be
controlled
by
a
single
signal
or
influenced
by
many
signals
each
response
may
be
stimulatory
increasing
an
activity
or
inhibitory
decreasing
an
activity
transmission
of
signals
may
damp
out
stimuli
or
amplify
them
Structures
of
regulatory

of
control
or
regulatory

as
assemblies
of
activities
Although
mediated
in
part
by
physical

macromoleculesproteinprotein
and

Cellcycle
regulation
is
a
classic
example
The
structure
of
a
regulatory
network
can
be
described
by
a
graph
in
which
edges
indicate
steps
in
pathways
of
control
Regulatory
networks
are
directed
graphs
the
influence
of
vertex
A

B
is
expressed
by
a
directed
edge
connecting
A
and
B
An
edge
directed
from
vertex
A
to
vertex
B
is
called
an
outgoing
connection
from
A
and
an
incoming
connection
to
B
Conventionally
an
arrow
indicates
a
stimulatory
interaction
and
a
T
symbol
indicates
an
inhibitory
interaction
An
edge
connecting
a
vertex
to
itself
indicates
autoregulation
A
double
headed
arrow
indicates
reciprocal
stimulation
of
two
nodes
note
that
this
is
not
the
same
as
an
undirected
edge

Structural
biology
of
regulatory
networks
Any
regulatory
interaction
involves
one
or
more
proteins
and
nucleic
acids
Examples
of
regulatory
mechanisms
include
a
protein
binding
a
ligand
undergoing
chemical
modification
such
as
phosphorylationdephosphorylation
changing
conformation
or
all
of
the
above
Xray
crystallography
and
NMR
spectroscopy
have
helped
us
to
elucidate
some
of
the
general
mechanisms
underlying
control
processes
Many
molecules
involved
in
regulation
are
multidomain
proteins
A
domain
is
a
segment
of
a
protein
that
has
independent
stability
and
can
appear
in
conjunction
with
different
partners
through
evolutionary
recombination
A
multidomain
protein
contains
a
linear
sequence
of
domains
each
of
which
is
relatively
free
to
interact
with
other
molecules
Assembly
of
a
protein
from
domains
therefore
permits
the
joining
into
one
molecule
of
a
set
of
functions
Mixing
and
matching
of
domains
gives
evolution
access
to
a
wide
variety
of
functional
combinations
See
Figures
24
and
88
One
important
feature
of
regulatory
proteins
is
recognition
An
interaction
domain
is
a
part
of
a
protein
that
confers
specificity
in
ligation
of
a
partner
Regulatory
proteins
contain
a
limited
number
of
types
of
interaction
domains
which
have
diverged
to
form
large
families
with
different
individual
specificities
For
instance
the
human
genome
contains
115
SH2
domains
and
253
SH3
domains
Srchomology
domains
SH2
and
SH3
are
named
for
their
homologies
to
domains
of
the
src
family
of
cytoplasmic
tyrosine
kinases
Many
individual
interaction
domains
even
interact
with
different
partners
as
they
participate
in
successive
steps
of
a
control
cascade
Initial
interactions
may
also
trigger
recruitment
of
additional
proteins
to
form
large
regulatory
complexes
Many
interaction
domains
are
sensitive
to
the
state
of
posttranslational
modification
of
their
ligands
for
instance
binding
preferentially
to
states
of
a
ligand
in
which
specific
tyrosines
serines
or
threonines
are
phosphorylated
These
and
other
posttranslational
modifications
function
as
switches
turning
on
or
interruptingresetting
a
signalling
cascade
Proteinprotein
complex
formation
allows
a
cell
to
detect
a
signal
molecule
in
the
external
medium
and
report
its
arrival
to
the
cell
interior
without
the
signal
molecule
itself
ever
needing
to
enter
the
cell
Many
receptors
use
an
ingenious
dimerization
mechanism
the
receptor
has
external
transmembrane
and
internal
segments
An
external
ligand
binds
to
two
molecules
of
receptor
The
juxtaposition
of
the
external
portions
brings
the
internal
portions
together
also
because
they
are
tethered
to
the
external
regions
by
the
transmembrane
segments
Interaction
between
the
interior
segments
triggers
a
conformational
change
that
activates
a
process
such
as
phosphorylation
of
a
protein
This
may
initiate
a
signal
transduction
cascade
that
can
amplify
the
original
stimulus

Understanding
the
mechanism
of
regulation
will
require
the
structures
of
large
protein
and
protein
nucleic
acid
complexes
The
sizes
of
many
of
the
large
complexes
challenges
the
limits
of
NMR
spectroscopy
Xray
diffraction
has
had
major
successes
but
is
at
the
mercy
of
being
able
to
grow
adequate
crystals
Cryoelectron
microscopy
is
another
approach
to
structure
determination
of
larger
assemblies
Electron
microscopy
of
specimens
at
liquid
nitrogen
temperatures
has
revealed
structures
in
the
range
M
r
500
000
to
4

8
1001500
in
diameter
These
results
do
not
achieve
atomic
resolution
However
if
the
structures
of
individual
components
of
a
complex
are
known
to
high
resolution
from
Xray
diffraction
or
NMR
spectroscopy
the
component
structures
can
be
fitted
into
the
lowresolution
structure
determined
by
electron
microscopy
to
produce
a
detailed
model
of
the
entire
assembly
See
Lesk

ff
A
limitation
that
remains
is
the
difficulty
of
determining
structures
of
transient
complexes
or
of
systems
showing
substantial
conformational
changes
upon
assembly
The
situation
is
shared
with
much
of
current
molecular
biology
we
are
coming
to
grips
with
static
structures
of
increasing
size
but
awaiting
the
development
of
methods
for
treating
the
dynamics
408The
genetic
switch
of
bacteriophage
Two
classic
control
systems
in
biology
are
well
understood
at
the
molecular
level
the
E
coli
Lac
operon
and
the
lyticlysogenic
switch
in
bacteriophage
These
are
also
the
simplest
examples
of
developmental
pathways
The
Lac
operon
is
a
set
of
genes
appearing
in
tandem
on
the
genome
of
E
coli
that
are
jointly
regulated
in
response
to
the
presence
of
lactose
and
glucose
in
the
medium
A

of
the

After
attaching
to
an
E
coli
cell
and
injecting
its
DNA
the
phage
may
follow
either
of
two
paths
in
the
lytic
state
replication
and
intracellular
reconstitution
of
daughter
phage
particles
is
followed
in
about
45
min
by
rupture
of
the
host
cell
and
release
of
the
100
progeny
The
expression
patterns
of
several
distinct
sets
of
genes
are
under
control
of
a
developmental
programme
during
this
process
in
the
lysogenic
state
the
phage
DNA
becomes
integrated
into
the
bacterial
genome
to
form
a
prophage
Only
one
phage
gene
is
expressed
the
cI
protein
which
acts
as
a
repressor
to
inhibit
the
expression
of
phage
genes
responsible
for
initiating
viral
multiplication
thereby
maintaining
the
lysogenic
state
Here
we
shall
focus
on
the
subset
of
the
regulatory
network
involved
in
the
switch
between
lytic
and
lysogenic
states
Given
a
healthy
host
population
the
lytic
state
perpetuates
itself
as
progeny
viruses
infect
additional
bacterial
cells
The
lysogenic
state
of
the
phage
is
stable
under
normal
conditions
The
viral
DNA
integrated
into
409the
bacterial
genome
replicates
with
the
bacterial
DNA
This
creates
a
population
of
infected
bacteria
Although
the
virus
does
not
reproduce
completely
to
form
intact
progeny
phage
the
viral
DNA
is
replicated
as
a
passenger
in
the
dividing
cells
Sleeping
Beauty
can
be
awakened
by
damage
such
as
UV
radiation
that
threatens
the
host
cell
The
virus
resumes
active
replication
to
escape
conditions
that
endanger
its
host
Of
course
this
ensures
that
the
host
cell
will
not
survive
The
strategy
of
the
virus
is
to
take
advantage
of
a
thriving
host
population
to
reproduce
lytically
but
to
adopt
lysogeny
to
get
through
lean
periods
M
Ptashne
and
colleagues
and
a
large
community
of
virologists
have
clarified
the
molecular
biology
of
phage
in
very
great
detail
Here
we
focus
on
the
logic
of
the
switch
What
are
the
characteristics
of
the
switch
that
must
be
implemented
by
DNAprotein
interactions
The
states
of
the
switch
must
be
mutually
incompatible
Each
state
must
repress
the
other
Under
constant
conditions
each
state
must
be
selfmaintaining
In
other
words
not
only
is
the
choice
of
one
or
the
other
commitment
enforced
once
selected
the

to

can
occur
only
upon

of

by

from

The
phage
may
either
remain
lytic

default
or
become

appears
to
be
determined
primarily
by

The

requires

of

of

The
concentrations
of
cII

appear
to
depend
primarily
on
the
dose
of
viral
DNA
About
1
of
cells
infected
by

virus
become
lysogenic
About
50
of
cells
infected
simultaneously
by
two
or
more
viruses
become
lysogenic
A
high
multiplicity
of
infection
implies
a
low
ratio
of
bacteria
to
phage
For
the
phage
to
remain
lytic
under
these
conditions
would
threaten
to
deplete
the
population
of
bacteria
to
the
point
where

considerations

if

A

Readers
may
wonder
why
the
cell
would
synthesize
a
molecule
that
promotes
lysis
and
why
the
phage
would
synthesize
one
that
promotes
lysogeny
Both
the
bacterium
and
the
phage
appear
to
be
acting
to
reduce
the
number
of
their
own
immediate
progeny
However
there
may
be
longterm
benefits
for
the
populations
as
a
whole
In
a
population
of
lysogenized
bacteria
occasionally
a
cell
spontaneously
goes
lytic
The
progeny
phage
do
not
damage
the
bacterial
populationremember
that
lysogeny
confers
immunity
to
phage
infectionbut
may
protect
the
bacterial
population
against
competition
with
foreign
invading
susceptible
bacteria
Sociobiologists
may
see
this
as
an
example
of
altruism
It

that

can
be
extracted

Common
motifs
in
biological
control
networks
415Within
the
high
complexity
of
typical
regulatory
networks
certain
common
patterns
appear
frequently
In
the
architecture
of
networks
these
form
building
blocks
that
contribute
to
higher
levels
of
organization
ShenOrr
Milo
Mangan
and
Alon
have
described
examples
including
the
fork
the
scatter
and
the
onetwo
punch
a
phrase
from
the
boxing
ring
The
fork
also
called
the
singleinput
motif
transmits
a
single
incoming
signal
to
two
outputs
Successive
forks
or
forks
with
higher
branching
degrees
are
an
effective
way
to
activate
large
sets
of
genes
from
a
single
impulse
Generalizations
of
the
binary
fork
include
more
downstream
genes
under
common
control
more
tines
to
the
fork
and
autoregulation
of
the
control
node
Forks
can
achieve
general
mobilization
Moreover
if
the
regulatory
genes
have
different
thresholds
for
activation
the
dynamics
of
building
up
the
signal
can
produce
a
temporal
pattern
of
successive
initiation
of
the
expression
of
different
genes
The
scatter
configuration
also
called
the
multiple
input
motif
can
function
as
a
logical
or
operation
both
downstream
targets
become
active
if
either
of
the
input
impulses
is
active
Generalizations
of
the
square
scatter
pattern
shown
may
contain
different
numbers
of

The
onetwo

also
called
the
feedforward
loop
affects
the
output
both
directly
through
the
vertical
link
and
indirectly
and
subsequently
through
the
intermediate
link
This
motif
can
show
interesting
temporal
behaviour
if
activation
of
the
target
requires
simultaneous
input
from
both
direct
and
indirect
paths
logical
and
Because
build
up
of
the
intermediate
requires
time
the
direct
signal
will
arrive
before
the
indirect
one
Therefore
a
short
pulsed
input
to
the
complex
will
not
activate
the
output
by
the
time
the
indirect
signal
builds
up
the
direct
signal
is
no
longer
active
The
system
can
thereby
filter
out
transient
stimuli
in
noisy
inputs
Conversely
the
active
state
of
the
system
can
shut
down
quickly
upon
withdrawal
of
the

response
Cell
cycling
and
sporulation
involve
the
unfolding
of
endogenous
gene
expression
programs
the
others
are
responses
to
environmental
changes
Different
states
are
characterized
both
by
similarities
and
differences
in
gene
expression
patterns
and
by
the
components
of
the
regulatory
network
that
are
active
There
is
considerable
shift
in
expression
of
target
genes
About
a
quarter
of
the
target
genes
are
specialized
to
individual
physiological
states
That
is
of
the
total
of
3420
target
genes
the
expression
of
almost
half
1514
do
not
show
major
changes
in
the
different
states
Of
the
1906
that
show
altered
expression
levels
in
different
states
almost
half
of
them
803
are
specialized
to
a
single
physiological
state
In
contrast
different
states
show
much
more
overlap
in
the
usage
of
transcriptional
regulators
For
instance
for
cellcycle
control
280
target
genes
8
are
differentially
regulated
by
70
49
of
the
transcription
regulators
Clearly
there
is
a
much
greater
degree
of
specialization
in
the
target
genes
In
general
half
the
transcription
factors
are
active
in
at
least
three
out
of
the
five
physiological
regimes
However
in
contrast
with
the
high
overlap
of
usage
of
the
transcriptional
regulators
the
nodes
the
overlap
of
the
activities
within
the
network
the
connections
is
relatively
low
Different
components
of
the
interaction
network
organize
the
different
gene
expression
patterns
in
different
states
Whereas
different
physiological
states
are
characterized
by
substitutions
of
different
sets
of
synthesized
proteins
the
regulatory
network
uses
much
of
the
same
structure
but
reconfigures
the
pattern
of
activity
Think
of
the
transcription
factors
as
hardware
and
the
connections
as
416reprogrammable
software
The
molecules
do
not
change
but
the
interactions
do
in
different
states
many
transcription
regulators
change
most
or
a
substantial
part
of
their
interactions
In
particular
the
set
of
transcription
regulators
that
form
the
hubs
of
the
networkthose
with
many
outgoing
nodes
that
form
foci
of
controlare
not
a
constant
feature
of
the
system
Some
hubs
are
common
to
all
states
but
others
step
forward
to
take
control
in
different
physiological
regimes
The
result
of
the
reconfiguration
of
activity
is
that
over
half
of
the
regulatory
interactions
are
unique
to
the
different
states
The
effect
of
the
changes
in
the
active
interaction
patterns
is
to
alter
the
topological
characteristics
of
the
network
in
different
states
For
instance
under
panic
conditionsDNA
damage
and
stress
the
average
number
of
genes
under
control
of
individual
transcriptional
regulators
increases
the
average
minimal
path
length
between
regulator
and
target
decreases
and
the
clustering
becomes
less
dense
that
is
there
is
less
interregulation
among
transcription
factors
This
can
be
understood
in
terms
of
a
need
for
fast
and
general
mobilization
the
equivalent
of
broadcasting
Go
Go
Go
over
the
radio
Normal
circumstancescellcycle
control
for
instanceallow
for
a
more
dignified
and
precise
regulatory
state
which
permits
finer
control
over
the
temporal
course
of
expression
patterns
In
cellcycle
control
and
sporulation
there
is
a
much
denser
interregulation
among
transcription
factors
and
longer
minimal
path
lengths
between
transcriptional
regulators
and
target
genes
Different
physiological
states
also
differ
in
their
usage
of
the
common
motifs
fork
scatter
and
onetwo
punch
see
Box
95
Scatter
motifs
are
more
used
in
conditions
of
stress
diauxic
shift
and
DNA
damage
They
are
appropriate
to
the
need
for
quick
action
Requirements
for
build
up
of
intermediates
would
delay
the
response
Conversely
the
onetwo
punch
motif
is
more
common
in
cellcycle
control
This
is
consistent
with
the
need
for
a
signal
from
one
stage
to
be
stabilized
before
the
cell
enters
the
next
stage
Much
of
evolution
proceeds
towards
greater
specialization
The
human
eye
is
a
classic
example
It
is
an
intricate
and
finetuned
structure
features
that
were
once
adduced
as
evidence
against
Darwins
theory
Many
evolutionary
pathways
show
a
tradeoff
between
specialized
adaptation
and
generalized
adaptability
Regulatory
networks
are
an
exception
Evolution
has
produced
structures
that
are
both
specialized
and
versatile
The
reconfigurability
of
regulatory
networks
allows
them
to
respond
robustly
to
changes
in
conditions
by
creating
many
different
structures
specialized
to
the
conditions
that
elicit
them

420CONCLUSION
How
can
we
extrapolate
from
the
current
state
of
play
to
the
bioinformatics
of
the
future
Clearly
data
collection
will
proceed
and
continue
to
accelerate
New
highthroughput
techniques
will
provide
additional
types
of
data
including
information
about
the

and
control
of
life
processes
Computing
facilities
of
increasing
power
will
be
applied
to
the
storage
distribution
and
analysis
of
the
results
New
databases
will
appear
on
the
web
and
links
between
databases
will
become
more
effective
Improved
algorithms
will
be
devised
to
analyse
and
interpret
the
information
given
us
and
to
transmute
it
from
data
to
knowledge
to
wisdom
Sequencing
power
will
continue
to
increase
and
the
amount
of
sequence
data
will
attain
immense
proportions
It
is
not
too
soon
to
plan
for
the
time
when
a
large
fraction
of
people
will
have
their
genomes
sequenced
completely
Metagenomics
will
provide
another
prolific
source
of
data
One
threshold
will
be
reached
when
our
knowledge
of
sequences
and
structures
becomes
more
nearly
complete
in
the
sense
that
a
fairly
dense
subset
of
the
available
data
from
contemporary
living
forms
has
been
collected
Of
course
there
is
no
question
of
being
able
to
know
everything
This
will
be
recognized
operationally
when
a
random
dip
into
the
pot
of
a
genome
or
the
isolation
of
a
new
protein
structure
is
far
more
likely
to
turn
up
something
already
known
rather
than
to
uncover
something
new
Nature
is
after
all
a
system
of
unlimited
possibilities
but
finite
choices
Applications
will
become
more
feasible
and
mature
ever
more
quickly
from
bluesky
research
to
standard
industrial
and
clinical
practice
Some
of
the
higher
levels
of
biological
information
transfer
such
as
the
programmes
of
genetic
development
during
the
lifetime
of
individuals
and
the
activities
of
the
human
mindwill
come
to
be
included
in
the
processes
we
can
describe
quantitatively
and
analyse
at
the
level
of
molecules
and
their
interactions
In
Michelangelos
frescos
on
the
ceiling
of
the
Sistine
Chapel
the
serpent
offering
Eve
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
is
represented
with
its
legs
coiled
around
the
tree
in
the
form
of
a
double
helix
We
can
hope
that
our
new
temptation
to
knowledge
embodied
in
another
double
helix
will
have
more
fortunate
consequences
